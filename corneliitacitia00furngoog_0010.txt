PREFACE.

Trra text of this volume, like that of the former, is
mainly that of Halm (ed. 4, Leipzig, 188 3)¹‚ but departs
from it somewhat oftener, usually in the direction of
retaining or approaching more closely to the Medicean
readings ².

In the commentary, Ι have to add to the acknow-
ledgements made in the first volume that of assistance
frequently derived from the edition of Emile Jacob
(Paris, 1877) ³, then unfortunately overlooked, and those
of Professor Holbrooke (London, 1882)⁴, and of Pfitzner,
(Gotha, 1885), which, as also a further portion (Fasc.
v-viii, pp. 481-928) of Gerber and Greef’s Lexicon, have
appeared since that volume was completed.

Among new works bearing on the subject-matter in
general, the chief place is due to the fifth volume of
