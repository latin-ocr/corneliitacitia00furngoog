to the third volume (in two parts) of the same author's
‘Rb'misches Staatsrecht' (Leipzig, 1887‚1888). To both
these works great and frequent obligations must be

Many other important sources to which I have been
indebted for information bearing on this volume sepa-
rately or on special parts of it, will be found mentioned
in notes prefixed to several portions of the Introduction
and to the Appendices ².

added may be found sufficient sor practical purposes.
The first includes all the proper names in the text,
and such other matter as appeared to be os sufficient

the Introduction and notes to these Eooks inordinate
in length, especially as so much general matter had
been treated once for all in the former volume: but sor
