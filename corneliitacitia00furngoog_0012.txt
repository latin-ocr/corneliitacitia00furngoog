this apparent excess l believe that some justification
can be offered.

It should be borne in mind that the whole time
covered is somewhat longer; the narrative having been
supplemented by summaries¹ so as to extend over the
thirtyone years from the death of Tiberius to that of
Nero. Also this period is far more fruitful in important
events and has attracted considerably more notice from
recent writers than that preceding it. The full investi-
gation os the life and rule of Claudius by Lehmann ²,
and the still more learned and elaborate treatise os

H. Schiller on the Neronian period ⁸, have no counter-
part ona similar scale relating to the time os Tiberius.
Special attention has also been bestowed by recent
scholars on the narrative of Eastem affairs during this
period⁴; and the chapters relating to the conquest of
Britain, though but a small portion of the narrative of

Tacitus, have deeply interested all antiquaries in this
country ⁶, and form a subject on which more is naturally
expected from an English than from a German editor
of the Annals. Even the single chapter, or portion
of a chapter, on the persecution of the Christiana has
received special attention from the chief recent ecclesi-
astical historians, and has raised many questions which

Under these circumstances it has seemed desirable to
place before general students such a statement aud criti-

subjects as could be fairly based on the narrative of
