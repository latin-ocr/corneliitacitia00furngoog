Tacitus, and should help them to estimate the general
value of his work as a historical authority. Ι may add
that it has also been my wish to make as complete as
I fairly could the commentary on a part of the author
which is not generally so much studied in England as to
be likely ostento encourage the undertaking of fresh
editions by future scholars.

In conclusion, 1 have to return my best thanks to
the Delegates of the University Press for accepting
this work, and to their staff for the care and accuracy
shown in the printing and revision.
