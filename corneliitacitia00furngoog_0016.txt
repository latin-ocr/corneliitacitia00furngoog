Timr vbich is now lrrrovn as the second Medicean MS. oi Tacitus is
a manuscript in Lombard characters, generally assigned to the latter hali
oi the eleventh century, aud thought by Ritter to have been one os the
many transcripts oi worlrs oi ancient authors madeat that date in the
great monastery of Monte Casino,

The latter part oi the MS. consists of the worlrs oi Apuleius, and contains
the solloving subscription, ‘Ego Sallustius legi et emendavi Romae felix
Olybrio et Probino cons. .. . Rursus Constantinopoli recognovi Caesario
et Attico conss! These dates are respectively uu. 395 arrd 397, and are
taken to be those oi the transcription and revision of the archetypal MS.;
but whether the same archetype or another oi the same date contained
the Tacitus, as well as the Apuleius here copied, is in no vvay evident.

Nothing appears to be known os the history os this MS. until the time
