a INTRODUCTION. [0100. 1.

Nicoli of Florence, one of the agents employed by him for collecting
manuscripts. In acknowledging its receipt, Bracciolini writes as follows
(Oct. ar), ‘Misisti mihi librum Senecae, et Cornelium Tacitum, quod est
mihi gratum: at is est litteris longobardis et maiori ex parte caducis, quod
si scissem, liberassem te eo labore. Legi olim quemdam apud uos
· manens litteris antiquis; nescio Coluciine esset an alterius. lllum cupio
habere uel alium qui legi possit: nam difficile erit reperire scriptorem,
qui hunc codicem recte legat; ideo cura ut aliurn habeam, si fieri potest.'
On further examination, he appears to have determined not to keep it,
and writes again to Nicoli (June 5, 14²8)= ‘Dedi Bartholomaeo de
Bardis decadem Livii et Cornelium Taciturn, ut illos ad te mittat: 10 100
Cornelio deficiunt plures chartae uariis in locis? The manuscript thus
returned to Nicoli was bequeathed by him to the Convent of St. Mark;
as appears by an inscription upon it, ‘Conventus S. Marci de Florentia
Ordinis Praedicatorum de hereditate Nicolai Nicoli Florentini viri
doctissimi! From thence it was, transferred to the Laurentian Library,
where it is at present preserved. The manuscript 10 written on parch-
ment, and the portion containing Tacitus must have consisted when
complete 01 105 leaves (now reduced to ¹03 by the loss of two leaves
containing respectively Hist. r. 69-75, and H. 1. 86-2. a), and contains
all that we have of these later Books 01 the Annals and the whole extant
part 01 1110 1110101100, all numbered consecutively as Books XVI-XXI.
At the end of the several Books is a subscription, ‘Cornelii Taciti Liber
. . . explicit, incipit . . .' The abrupt conclusion of the roth Book 01 1110
Annals has however no such subscription, and the first sentence 01 the
Histories 10 written 10 red letters 01 larger siae, so as in some sort to
marka new commencement. Also there is no subscription at the end 01
Book XXI (Hist. 5), which leaves oli in the middle 01 a column, so as to
show that there was no more in the exemplar.

It will be seen above, that, even in the time 01 Bracciolini, the hand·
writing, besides being in the difficolt Lombard character, had in many
places become faded and indistinct by time ¹. Since that date, a later
hand has endeavoured to reproduce the text 01 these passages in the
interlinear spaces; and, through errors committed in this attempt, many

false readings have subsequently passed current as the true Medicean

text.
Many other manuscripts¹ 01 this portion 01 the worlrs 01 Tacitus exist,
