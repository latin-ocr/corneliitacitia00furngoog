but none of them can claim any earlier date than the middle of the 15th
century. Many are known not to have been direct transcripta of the
Medicean, and very few are even supposed to be such. The best known
of them are classed by Walther and Ruperti in two main groups. The
one consists of five¹ expressly stated to have been transcribed from a

‘Codex Genuensis’ now lost, and 3 311111 ², the text of which closely '

resembles theirs. Another group of six', called by Walther (with less
propriety) the Roman group, shows traces of a common exemplar,
distinct from the ‘Genuensis’ To these a third group should be added
comprising two Florentiae manuscripts in the Laurentian Library ⁴,
¹which appear to approach most nearly to the Medicean text. The
affinities of the others⁵ have not been traced.

Respecting the source 01 the ‘Genuensis' and other parents of these
MSS. nothing can now be known. lt should however be noted that the
loss of the two leaves in the First and Second Books 01 the Histories⁸ had
certainly taken place before 1542 ⁷, and may have been one of the mutila·
11003 complained of by Bracciolini in 1428³; but the lost matter is
preserved in all the inferior manuscripts ⁹. T his would show that the
Medicean, if it is their ultimate source, had been already transcribed
before this mutilation happened to it; and it is also evident from the
correspondence that some other copy 01 Tacitus had been seen by
Bracciolini¹⁰. An alternative theory, that these MSS. were not derived
frorn the Medicean, but from some other old MS. coordinate with it and
