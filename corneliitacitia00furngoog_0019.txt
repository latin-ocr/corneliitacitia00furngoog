prooeeding from the same archetypal MS, has been adopted by some
editors, notably by Walther, who has carefully given in his notes, as of
value, all such of their various readings as were known to him. Recent
editors, however, have generally held that all the other MSS. are ultimately
derived from the Medicean, and that their readings are only worth quot·
ing, either as successful emendations of its errors, or as perhaps preserving
its text in places where it has now become illegible.

This portion ol the works of Tacitus became thus known to the Italian
scholars eighty years earlier than the first six Books of the Annals ¹; but
in other respects the history of its text bas been less fortunate. The
first Medicean, besides being in itself a better manuscript than the second,
was the sole source os the Books contained init, and had therefore
necessarily to be used in printing them; but in the case ol the other
Books‚ other more accessible and far more legible manuscripts were
exclusively followed, whether for subsequent transcripte or early printed
editions, and the Medicean was wholly or comparatively neglected.

The ‘editio princeps' of Vindelin de Spira, ascertained to have been
publisbed at Venice in 1470, is said to have been printed from a MS.
now lost, but then existing in the Library of St. Mark at Venice, which
appears to have belonged to that styled by Walther the ‘Roman' group
os MSS. The next edition, that ol Franciseus Puteolanus of Parma,
believed to have been publisbed at Milan in 1475, is based on some
manuscript of the ‘Genuensis' family ⁵. T hat of Beroaldus, the ‘editio
princeps’ of the whole of the Annals (Rome, 1514), though perforce
following tlte first Medicean for the first six Books, was content to take
the rest from Puteolanus.

The earliest known collation of the second Medicean MS. is that of
Petrus Victorius (Piero Vettorl), a learned Florentine of the 16th century,
who annotated the results of his study of it on a copy of the edition of
Beroaldus, preserved in the Library at Munich, adding this inscription at
the end of the Histories: ‘Recognovi curn vetusto exemplari literis

by, or known to, any earlier editor than Walther³. The collatione
known to scholars were those of Curtius Pichena (given in his edition of
