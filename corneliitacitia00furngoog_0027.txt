The great event of this year was the invasion oi Britain by the Roman
army under Α. Plautius Silvanus, who was afterwards joined lor sixteen
days by Claudius himself ⁴. It was probably also in this year that the
dissensions between Gotarzes and Vardanes enabled Mithridates, formerly
king oi Anneuia, to recover that country with the aid 01 some Roman
troops ⁸. In this year also⁶ Messalina is stated to have caused the death
os Justus Catonius ⁷, the praef. praetorio (who had intended to give insor-

mation ol her immorality), and Julia, the daughter ol Drusus and wife ol
Rubellius Blandus ⁸.

Early in this year Claudius returned from Britain, having been altogether
six months absent srom Rome, and celebrated his triumph, which gover-
nors oi provinces and even exiles were allowed to return and witness ¹¹.
He also held games in honour ol his victory ¹¹. His iniant son took the
name ol Britannicus, and many others received honours and decoratione ¹³.
ln the same year ¹⁴ Macedonia and Achaia were given back to the senate ¹⁵3
the quaestorial districts in Italy were abolished ¹⁸, and quaestore instead ol
praetors placed over the aerarium ¹⁷. M. lulius Cottius received his iather'e
dominion (the Cottian Alpe) with the title 01 king, and Rbodes was
deprived 01 its freedom lor outrage on Roman citizens ¹⁸. To this year
also belongs the death ol King Herodes Agrippa, the partition 01 his
dominions, and the appointment again of a procurator ol Judaea ¹'.
