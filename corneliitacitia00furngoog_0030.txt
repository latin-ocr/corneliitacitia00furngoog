omna] RULE OF GAJUS. 15

The boy, with his brothers and sisters, shared the triumph of his
father ¹, was one of the two with him at his death in Syria, and followed
the moumful procession of his mother with the remeius*⁸ Aller this,
Tacitus makes no mention of him for several years, during which time
we are told by Suetonius that he was under the tutelage first of his
mother, then of his great-grandmother Augusta⁸, and, after the death of
the latter, under that of his grandmother Antonia.

The far-reaching airns of Seianus are stated to have included aplan
for his assassination at the same time with that of Tiberius ⁴.

He assumed the toga virilis at a later age than his brothers and with·
out the distinctions granted to them⁸3 and then or soon afterwards
received in marriage Junia clandida, daughter of M. Silanus, and accom-
panied Tiberius to Capreae ⁸, where most of his next four years were
spent, years which must have done much to form his character. We are
to think of him as at once schooling his violent and impulsiva temper²
to live under· the suspicious glance of those penetrating eyes, as ‘veiling
the ferocity of his spirit under a mask of submission⁸', and ‘learning
every artifice· of falsehood in the intimacy of his grandfather ⁹! The
successive stages in the fate of lris mother and brother failed to elicit a
word from his lips and appeared to make no impression on his mind:
his one airn frorn day to day was to study the mood of Tiberius and
adapt every word and look to it; so that the witticism spread that ‘never
was there man who would be a better slave or a viler master ¹⁰! Tiberius,
who himself had under Augustus passed through a similar period of
disguise and repression, while to outward appearance satisfied with his
submissiveness, was -not likely to be really deceived by it. lle gave
him no higher magistracy than the quaestorship ¹¹ (carrying with it
admission to the lowest rank of senators), and no other mark of honour
but the pontificale ¹⁹, and not seldom let fall expressions which showed
