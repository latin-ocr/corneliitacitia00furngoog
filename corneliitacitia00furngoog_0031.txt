The old man would gladly have so ordered the succession’ as to set
aside the adoptive grandson sor the grandson by blood ; but the knowledge
that T iberius Gemellus was too young, and that in any case the tide os
popular favour would run high for the son ol Germanicus, led him to
leave the iuture to take its own course, though he could see irom the
scowl with which the elder looked on the younger what that course
would be‘.

Galus again had shrewdness enough to see that, whether Tiberius
intended to attempt to provide sor the succession or not, the real masters
ol the situation were the praetoriana, and that their praelect would be his
best ally. Nor was Macro in his turn slow to ‘worship the rising instead
of the setting sun,' and even to sacrifice his wile's honour to cement the

gradual stages, ou the mere removal ol enforced disguise. We should
suppose him to have entirely disbelieved that the popular acts and pro·

intention to govern justly and moderately, or that the succeeding insanity,
