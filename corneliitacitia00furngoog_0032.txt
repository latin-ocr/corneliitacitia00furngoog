the effect as the cause of reclrless profligacy‚ had any other effect on his
moral character than so far as it led him more completely to drop the
mask, cast away the last restraints of common decency and prudence‚
and follow the bent of a nature long since thoroughly vitiated ¹.

When however we consider that, out of the four Books and a half
given to the events of the ten years succeeding the death of Tiberius (a
larger amount than is ever elsewhere allotted to a similar space within the
period of thelmala), probably two Books were occupied with those of
this principate of hardly four years' duration, we may feel sure that so
weighty a historiari found in it material of more historical importance
than such as survives to usin Suetonius or Dio ².

It is also to be horne in mind that his purpose professed at the
beginning ol his work, of holding a balance between the extravagances
of adulation and abuse ³, and his belief that he has succeeded in doing
so, applies to Gaius as well as to the other princes contained in it, and
makes it probable that in his case, as we have already seen in that of
Tiberius, some of the scandals and outrages which other historiens have
raked together would have been discredited‚ and many incredible ex-
aggerations reduced to their just dimensions.

One general trait of considerable interest has been preserved ιο us in
the incidental mention that the disordered intellect of Gaius was never-
theless consistent with considerable oratorical vigour⁴; a statement
which may well be illustrated by the epigrammatic point of some of his
personalitiest, and the shrewd, however merciless, logic pervading his
repartees and other reported utterances.

Some of the principal remaining allusions to his acts show that Tacitus
followed the general account of the absnrd flasco of the German expedi-
tion ⁸, and considered that its failure, combined with the characteristic
caprice of Gaius himself, caused the abandonment of what he believed to
have been a seriously entertained project of invading Britain ἵ. It is
disappointing that we have here no suggestion of a rational explanation
