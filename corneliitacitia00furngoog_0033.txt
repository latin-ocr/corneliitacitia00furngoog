os these events' which seems not impossible. Lentulus Gaetulicus,
legatus of Upper Germany, already sormidable under Tiberius, and
influentia] with the army oi Lower Germany, as well as master oi his
own ¹, was apparently organising a conspiracy, connived at by perhaps
both the surviving sisters ol the Emperor, and supported by Lepidus, his
brother-in-law and hinsman². It is possible to suppose that this treason
on loot was already known, and that the projected German and British
expeditions were no more than the alleged object sor collecting in Gaul
such an army as would suffice to cow the German legions, and suppress
the danger without bloodshed³ ; and that in all the rest we have only
some clumsy attempts to sustain the pretext ⁴.

We have also a criticism by Tacitus on the blundering manner in
which Gaius, suspicious ol the eminence oi M. Silanus corrected the
anomaly, previously deemed harmless, by which, in Africa alone among
all the senatorial provinces, the proconsul had command os a legion and
of the auxiliarios attached to it ⁵. His introduction oia dual govern-
ment, by placing the legion under a ‘legatus Augusti,' whose authority
clashed with that ol the proconsul, was inritful, as might have been
expected, in jealousy and discord⁸; but the change so lar commended
itsels to his successors that the old anomaly was never restored, though
care was taken at a subsequent tirne to remove the evil ol an ‘imperium
in imperio,’ by constituting Numidia as a separate province under the
legatus, and concentrating the whole military force within it ⁷.

A single sentence relating to the insane command of Gaius that his
statue should bc set up in the temple at Jerusalem, may be quoted as so
sar showing a difference from Josephus as apparently to represent an
outbrealr to have actually commenced⁸.
