Within these nanow limita is confined all the help that we can obtain
lrom Tacitus towards judging Gaius either in youth or ruanhood ; nor

monsters ol mankind.

of Claudiae, though comprising probably more than one third ol the

not thought fit to give at the close ol his lile any general summary ol his
character, as is done in the Annals lor Tiberius ¹, and in the Histories
lor Galba ², and also (more briefly) ior Otho ³ and Vitellius ¹.

death, harassed in childhood by such a succession ol illnesses as penna-
