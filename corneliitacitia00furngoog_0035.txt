20 INTRODUCTION. [om. 111.

and gifted brother was pushed forward rapidly in public life, and known
by only one redeeming trait, his early passion for study. Augustus

indeed, though by no means allowing him to make an exhibition of
himself in public, showed some regard for him in private life, and had
the iusight to see that when he could command 1110 faculties, he was by
no means the fool he seemed¹: yet even he, though thus showing more
consideration than other and nearer relatives, was so far dissatisfied with
him as to allow him οο other distinction than an augurship, and to give
him onlya low position und trifling legacy in his will ’ς while from the
stern and ungenial Tiberius he had less indulgence to expect. He was
now earnestly desirous of filling the magistracies of state, but was put off
with the ‘ornamenta consularia’3 afurther request was met with the
contemptuous gift ofa few gold pieces to spend at the Saturnalia³3 and
be retired into shadow during the rest of this prince's rule, with 00
further distinction then that of a place among the ‘sodales Augustales ‘.'
Though now the head of the Claudian house 1, second only in dignity to
the Julian, he had 00 position in the senate 1, and merely ranked as a
knight 1. Α trivial incident showing the tendency of all rnen to take no
account of him⁸ gives Tacitus an opportunity for the bitter comment,
‘the more I think on ancient or recent examples, the more is the mockery
pervading human affairs in all matters made evident to me. By repu-
tation, by promise, by the respect of men, any one seemed rather destined
to imperial dignity than he whom fortune was reserving in secret as the
future prince.’

Thus 10 the twenty-four years of childhood and youth under Augustus,
are to be added twenty-two more, passed in complete retirement under
Tiberius, in which, despised by those 01 his own rank, and bashful in good
society,hetookrefuge iu low habits and low company⁹. These surroundings
