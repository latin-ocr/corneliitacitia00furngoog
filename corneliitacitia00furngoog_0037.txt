to all, but also what may have lain beneath the surface3 whether not
only this tame submission to every kind of insuit, but even some studied
exaggeration of his natural weakness and eccentricity, may not have
been assumed for aelf-protection¹, as according to the old tale was the
demeanour of Brutus under Tarquinius, or as had been the servility of
Gaius himself under Tiberius ¹. It can, indeed, be hardly doubted that
his position had another side to it, at a dme when all thinking men could
foresee that the existing tyranny must needs be shortlived; that its out·
come would not be (as some loudly dreamt)a return to the old Republic‚
but the succession of some other princeps ; that while direct or collateral
descendants of Augustus lived, their names would weigh powerfully in
the scale against any others3 and that within that circle Claudius, with
all his drawbacks, was most prominent ⁸.

It was not without political foresight that the freedman Callistus chose
to pay court to Claudius rather than destroy him ⁴; that his old friend
Herodes Agrippa still kept up his intimacy⁵; that the senate as a body
paid him what was evidently intended as a compliment by choosing him
on the deputation above referred to ⁸. Nor can we suppose him to have
been himself so obtuse as not to keep an eye on his own prospects
throughout his apparent effacement 3 nor was it without a political motive
that he contracted during this period a far higher matrimonial alliance
than any of his previous ones, by taking to wife Valeria Messalina, who
was a direct descendant, through both ber parents, from Octavia ⁷, and
might have added to the chance of any of his possible rivals by a similar
connection.

lt is also easy to see that in his actual elevation to the principate
deeper causes were working than a mere soldier's freak, however true
