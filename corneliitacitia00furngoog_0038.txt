0111111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 23

unawares in full view of the end for which he and his adherents may have
been none the less deliberately laying their pians.

Our most serious loss is that of the record and judgment of Tacitus
respecting the first and best years of this principate, one which we cau
the better realise by reflectiug how much less we should have known
of the rule of Tiberius, ifthe first three Books of the Annals had not
come down to us. As regards mere material, it is no doubt true
that our other authorities here do more to fill the gap. Josephus, by
large portions of his narrative, and especially by the original texts
of ediets of the emperor and of Petronius, his legatus in Syria,
preserved in it, has given us valuahle information on many subjects‚
especially on the policy adopted towards the Jewish race¹: a few facts
of historical interest may be found among those noted by the elder
Pliny ; to his nephew we owe the touching history of Paetus and Arria²3
and the reader may derive entertaiument, if not instruction, from Seneca,
whose disregard, not only for truth, but even for his own consisteucy,
allows us to lind, in what he says of Claudius an equally extreme
instance of each of the kinds of falsification, in which Tacitus tells us
that the historias of the whole period covered by his Annals abounded 1,
Iu the ‘Consolatio’ addressed from his place of exile to Polybius 1, the
resources of language can hardly find terms for the gentleness aud
clemeucy⁰ of the prinee under whom it was the freedmau’s happy
lot to live; and under whom even exiles rested in peace 1. Fortune
is prayed to preserve one granted to the relief of a wem-out age, and
herself bidden tolcam from him to be 1111111111. He is himself
imagined as drawing on the unrivalled stores of his eloquence and
learning to address topica of consolation to his minister⁸3 whom the
writer bids to seelr his own solace in the sunshiue of that presence 1,
of that deity within whose influence no sorrow cau reach him ¹⁰. It is
hard indeed to believe that we are reading from the same author whose
pen has described a monster of cruelty to usin the ‘Ludus’ Some
allowance must be made for the difference in date of the two pictures ¹¹3
