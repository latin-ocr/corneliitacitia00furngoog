24 INTRODUCTION. [cm. 111.

for the rest, the servile flattery and scathing satire must be leli to
counterbalance and discredit each other.

Our only continuous and consecutive narrative, that of Dio, shrinks
into the epitome of Xiphilinus at a point a little before that at which
we recover the guidance of Tacitus, and is, unfortunately, somewhat
meagre as a whole in proportion to the general scale of the history¹;

but on many important points, especially on the conquest of Britain,
is our sole detailed authority.

From these sources, aided hythe miscellaneous ‘farrago’ of Suetonius,
our record of the first six years of this prince's rule has to be gathered²,
so far as it is needful for the present purpose to trace its outlincs.

1t must be borne in mind that Claudius and his advisere, while thus
taking the reins at a moment's notice, succeeded to no such well-
ordered empire as had been transmitted by Augustus to Tiberius and by
him to Gaius, but to one full of confusion and misgovernment. The
bloody deed of Jan. 24 had revived the memory of die ides of March
of sc. 44, and had shaken the foundations of Caesarism; the threads
of continuity had been snapped, the State had been two days without

an open question ³. The executions and extortions of the late tyranny
had thoroughly alienated the rich, while the populace, though probably
fortunate enough to be ignorant of their peril, and deploring the loss
of what must have seemed a golden age of amusements ⁴, were in
imminent danger of all the horrors of famine ⁶. Abroad, Gaius had
unsettled everything and settled nothing; had pillaged Gauii, stirred up
the long slumbering hostility of the German tribes, driven Palestine into
open rebellion, flouted the deputation sent to plead for the persecuted Jews
of Alexandria, had created or deposed vassal princes at the humour of
his caprice, and, by the murder or detention of their legitimate rulers,
