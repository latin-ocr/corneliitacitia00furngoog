had leit Mauretania a prey to war, Commagene to anarchy‚ and had
abandoned the great kingdom os Armenia to the control of Parthia ¹.

The difficulties ol this situation were dealt with by the new govern-
ment in a spirit ol deliberation and lorethought hardly to be expected
ol persons taken unawares. The most urgent danger, that ol lamine,
appears to have been averted lor the present by energetic temporary
measures ¹, and was to be lessened in future by great improvements
projected in the harbourage ol Ostia ³. Another necessary oi lile was
to be provided in abundance by taking up vigorously and carrying out
to its accomplishment the aqueduct begun by Gaius ⁴. Another great
work, undertaken at an early date ⁵, the tunnel irom Lake Fucinus to the
Liris, appears to have had some relation to the lood supply; but it is
difficult to see what result commensurate with the enonnous cost could
ever have been expected ⁸.

Another question pressing for immediate decision was that ol those
compromised in the recent conspiracy. Tyrannicida could not be
tolerated, and therefore the actual assassins had to die ; but ol the rest,
even those who had been talked ol as aspirante to the principate, or who
had advocated the restoration oi the Republic, were included in a com·
prehensive amnesty, and even allowed to win further distinctions; a
similar pardon being also extended to those who had heaped insults
on Claudius at his nephew's biddingl.

The emperor had also to detine the rule to which he had succeeded;
and in this it is hardly too much to say that the lines of the imperial
constitution had to be retraced. The memory oi the late tyranny was
effaced the insane titles adopted hy Gaius were abolished‚ his ‘acta’
