rescinded, his exiles, especially his two sistere Agrippina and Julia,
recalled, many of his extortions and confiscations restored to the
sufferers or their heire, his statues were silently removed, his debased
coinage was called in ¹.

In name and form, the Augustan idea of a citizen prince was to be
restored. The most sacred oath of Claudius was ‘per Augustum ¹'; and,
to associate himself with a divine ancestry, he procured for his grand·
mother Livia a tardy deification, with special honours to keep up her
name ⁸. Further respect was shown to the memory of his still popular
brother Germanicus, his father Drusus, his mother Antonia; and even
her father M. Antonius was honourably mentioned ⁴. By thus promi·
nently bringing into notice his relationships to the previous ruling house,
and by himself assuming the cognomen ‘Caesar,' he would endeavour
to sustain the fiction of a continuity of succession3 though his name was
still significant ofa change; the house of the Julii Caesares, to which
Augustus and his successore had nominally and by adoption yet belonged,
having been left without any male representative at the death of Gaius,
while no such family as the ‘Claudii Caesares' had ever existed, and the
name would seem to an antiquarian genealogist a strange misnomer.
From this time, therefore, it was distinctly to be understood that ‘Caesar’
had passed from a family name to an imperial title.

The Claudian name was sufficiently near to the Julian to prevent
the few remaining great houses from feeling degraded by its exaltation,
and some of the most prominent were conciliated by politic alliances.
The infant Octavia, whose name recalled the sister of Augustus (her
ancestress ina threefold line), was promised in marriage to L. Junius
Silanus, the great-great-grandson of Augustusl, while Antonia, the
emperor's daughter by Paetina, was betrothed to Cn. Pompeius Magnus ⁶,
a representative not only of that famous name, but also of the Calpurnii
Pisones, the Licinii Crassi, and Scribonia.

Besides thus winning the support of great families, he conciliates the
senate as a whole by the deference paid to its authority ⁷. It was to be
