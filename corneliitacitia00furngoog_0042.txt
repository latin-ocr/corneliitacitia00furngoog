cnr. ιιι] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 27

consulted on all matters of state ², as in lormer times; even the restoration
ol exiles was submitted to its approval ¹, and the allowance ol a small
guard ol honour to the emperor within its precincts was asked as a
lavour³2 and not only at the outset, but throughout his rule, he shows
himself desimus to keep up the dignity of that body, by purging it
ol unworthy members ⁴, and by inlusing into it new and healthier blood⁵
lrom the ranhs below ⁸, and even from provincial sources ⁷. A similar
recruiting‚ later in the course ol his rule, oi the ranlrs os the patriciato ⁸,
would make it easier to fill the few priestly offices still confined to that
body ⁹. Other acte, extending to all ranks aliie, were probably in effect
an especial boon to the upper classes. The law oi ‘maiestas' by which
Tiberius had decimated the senatorial and equestrian aristocracy, was
allowed to sink into oblivion ¹⁰, and the princeps solemnly swore that no
Roman citizen should be put to torture ¹¹. It was no doubt by these and
other similar measures that Claudius won a permanent place among
constitutional ‘principes ¹²‚’ and earned the title os ‘libertatis vindex¹⁸,'
while he compensated the lower orders ior the curtailment ol the great
shows and largesses oi Gaius ¹⁴ by the gradual abolition ol his imposts ¹⁵,
and by this and other means gained no slight popularity ¹⁸.

lmportant regulations were also made in the admiriistration of the
linances os the empire, which must have become altogether disorganised.

In respect oi the ‘aerarium publicum‚’ it was perhaps a mere stroke
ol antiquarianism to transler the charge from praetore to quaestors ; nor
was the change beneficiat, except so far as it substituted selection for
the haphazard ol the lot, and allowed time to gain experiente by pro-
longing the tenure oi office ¹⁷.
