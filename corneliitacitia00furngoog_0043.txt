duced in respect oi the vast revenues under the direct control oi the
princeps ¹.

On the division ol the empire made by Augustus, the income oi the
Caesarian provinces had been as matter of course received by him, no
doubt with some such understanding as existed with regard to the
‘manubiae’ ol a general, that it should be expended on the public
service, and possibly subject to a formal liabiiity to render account, had
any of his fictione of surrendering his imperium become areality. As
a lact, some statement os accounts vas made from time to time by
Augustus and his immediate successom', nor can it be doubted that
he and they observed a carelul distinction between their ‘patrimonium'
and the income received in virtue ol their offioe', though both alike were
designated as ‘res suae,' ‘res familiaris' &c ⁴, and though there is no
sufficient trace ol any central department oi imperial linance⁸, which,
so iar as it was centralised at ali, must have been administered by the
princeps personally.

It is apparently from the time ol Claudius· that we begin to find used
in contrast to ‘aerarium' the term ‘fiscus’ or ‘fiscus Caesaris'3 and,
as the choice of this name would seem to have been determined by
its use under the Republic to denote the public store kept in the
treasury or sent from it to a magistrate ², and under the early Empire
aa a name ior the euchequer oi this or that separate province or
department ⁸, it had attached to it, notwithstanding its distinction lrom
the aerarium, the associatione ola public fund ol some sort.
