It is also from this date that the great department ‘a rationibus,’ with
its presiding freedman¹ and its staff ¹, appears to originate, or at least
to attain its importance, still indeed, and for some time to come, in form
andin the rank of ita functionaries, a mere department 31 1133 household
of the princeps, but not, as it would seem, without some quasi-magisterial
accountability 33 1133 part of its chief ³.

the recollection of the intended outrage survived, recalling dangerous
memories 31 Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabeos and ready 33 any
pretext to burst into a flame⁹. By withdrawing the insignia of Roman
rule from the country, and placing Agrippa over the¹ whole dominion
which 1313 grandfather had held under Augustus ¹⁰, the double end was
gained 31 rewarding a valuable ally, and 31 securing the temporary
tranquillity of the country, under the rule of one who, though personally
dissolute and worthless, had the popularity ¹¹ which a native prince alone
could win.
