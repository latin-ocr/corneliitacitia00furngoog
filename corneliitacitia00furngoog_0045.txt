by previous emperors to the Jews are fully guaranteed¹, and insults to
themselves and their religion, such as a subsequent edict of Petronius,
legate of Syria ¹, shows to have been even afterwards prevalent, were
forbidden. The warning added in one of these edicts to the Jews them-
selves shows that they also had similarly transgressed, and throws light
on another act of opposite spirit, whereby the Jews in Rome itself (their
only considerable settlement in the west ³) were punished for some act of
turbulence by expulsion ⁴, or at least by inhibition from exercise of their
worship ⁰. This edict of intolerance would however seem to have been
(as in a former ease under Tiberius ⁶) only temporarily or partially
carried ortt

ln Armenia, the position held. under Tiberius was reestablished by
releasing⁸ and sending baclr Mithridates, the king originally chosen by
him ⁹, who was enabled by the temporary weakness of Parthia to recover
and maintain his authority ¹⁰.

The appointment of another Mithridates to the kingdom of Bospoms
was less successful ¹¹.

In Commagene, the wiser arrangement of Tiberius, who had consti-
tuted it as aprovinoe ¹², was not reestablished, but Antiochus, whom Gaius
had made king of the country but afterwards deposed and detained at
Rome, was sent back ¹³. The other vassal kings whom it had pleased
Gaius to set up, such as Cotys of LesserArmenia¹⁴, Sohaemus of Ituraea¹⁶,
were left in possession. In another corner of Asia, the small free state
of Lycia paid the penalty of its turbulence and anarchy in the loss of its
independence¹⁶, a change which resulted in its complete Hellenizationff.
The Rhodians soon afterwards suffered a similar penalty, but only
temporarily¹⁸.

In Mauretania, a restoration of tbe former state was impossible.
