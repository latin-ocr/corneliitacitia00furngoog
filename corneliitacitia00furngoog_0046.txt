cm.111.] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 31

Ptolemaeus had been summoned to Rome, and afterwards executed by
Gaius ¹, and had apparently left no heirs. His freedman Aedemon bad
raised the standard of national independence, and had led into the fast-
nesses of Mount Atlas the wild tribesmen⁸‚ many of whose fathers had
troubled the Romans already under Tacfarinas ⁸. Roman forces appear
to have been already sent against them by Gaius‘3 but it was not till
the second year of Claudius that their subjugation was accomplished by
the able generals Suetonius Paulinus and Hosidius Geta⁶3 after which
the country was divided into two provinces under procuratorsl, with
considerable military force ⁷, and the process of civilization and Romani-
zation begun under Augustus received a further impulse ⁸.

lt is, however, rather in the history of the European than of the
Asiatic or African provinces that the govemment of this prince constitutes
an era. lt was probably from an exaggerated deference for the con-
stitution of Augustus, coupled with the desire to show respect to the
senate, that Macedonia and Achaia were given back to the rule of
senatorial proconsuls and the change made by Tiberius in the interest
of the provinciale themselves was reversed ⁰. A far more considerable
and beneficial change was that by which the large dependent kingdom of
Thrace was reduced in 799, an. 46, toa province ¹⁰. The circumstances
which led to the change are unknown to us; but we have sufficient
evidence in past history that the lrings set up by Rome were here, as
elsewhere, unable to command the obedience of their subjects ¹¹, and were
only lrept on their thrones by frequent interference of their protectors ¹²3
and that the direct government ol part of the country, under the form of
wardship, had shared the usual fate of half measures¹³ ; while the great
value of the country as a recruiting ground was only to be turned to
account at the cost of insurrection ¹⁴. The change appears not to have
been accomplished without bloodshed¹⁸, but to have been thoroughly
successful. Order was maintained by a procurator ¹⁰, and a garrison
of two thousand troops ¹⁷ ; and ‘hardly any province furnished so
