movement which would have carried him even beyond the Weser ¹,
when he was peremptorily ordered to withdraw behind the Rhine, and
to evacuate even what he had already won. This policy, whether of
timidity or pnrdence¹, became a permanent law; and although some
tribes³ still remained in subjection, and tracts of pasture land are
retained for the commissariat of the legions ⁴, no trace of military
occupatiori on the right bank of the Lower Rhine remainst.

All other military achievements of this period are eclipsed by the
invasion and permanent occupation of Britain, the first and (till the time
of Trajan) the only great departure from the cautious policy bequeathed
by Augustus to his successom‘, and (as Claudius and his flatterers were
never weary of repeating ²) the first and only establishment of a trans·
oceanic province. We need only note here the forethought and
strategio ability with which it was carried out, on a scale which recog·
nised at once the practicability and the difficulties of the enterprise ⁸.

This review of the foreign policy of Claudius would still be incomplete
withouta notice of the manner in which he conceives and carries out,
with a boldness far beyond that of his immediate predecessors, the
Roman idea of consolidation consequent upon conquest. Personal
predilection‚ as well as the ripeness of the country for the apphcation
of the principle, combine to make Gaul the chief field in which this
policy is displayed. It may probably have been frorn him that Vienna
received its full burgess rights⁹; and the general measure by which

of civic population noted at his census ¹² is probably due in no small
measure to his own comprehensive policy ; and the sarcasm of Seneca ¹³,
