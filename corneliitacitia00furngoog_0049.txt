ness ol Roman aristocracy‚ is only discreditable to himself.

Colonisation, always a powerful engine in the Romanization of the
empire, had been in abeyance since the days of Augustus, but now
receives an energetic impulse. 'l'o Claudius the famous towns oi Augusta
Treveronrm¹ (Trier or Treves) and, in his later years, Colonia Agrip-
pinensis⁸ (Kdln), and Camulodunum⁸ (Colchester) owed their status;
while less celebrated instances such as Sabaria⁴ (Stein) in Pannonia,
Aequum⁵ in Delmatia, Apri⁸ in Thrace, Iconium⁷ in Lycaonia, Arche-
lais⁸ in Cappadocia, Ptolemais⁹ (Aere) in Syria, and no less than six
places (Tingi, Lixus, Iol or Caesarea, Oppidum Novum, Rusucurium,

“ and Tipasa) either colonised or otherwise endowed with civic or Latin

rights in the newly constituted provinces of Mauretania ¹⁰, show a steady
purpose carried out in all parts oi the empire.

The names assumed by towns, as Claudiopolis ¹¹ (Bithynia and Cappa-
docia), Neo-Claudiopolis¹¹ (Galatia), Claudia Paphos ¹³ (Cyprus), seem
to point to a gift of some favours or privileges which we cannot identily,
as may also be the case with some of the many statues, medab, dc.
belonging to this time, found in various places throughout the Roman
world ¹⁴.

This sketch ol the general policy at home and abroad, as initiated at
the outset, and in many points consistently maintained throughout ¹⁵, will
sufficiently support the credit for statesmanship which must be awarded
to Claudius personally or shared by him with advisers ¹⁸ whom he had at

. least the good sense to follow; and will show how great deductiori must

be made from the representatione of Roman satirists. Yet the satire is
