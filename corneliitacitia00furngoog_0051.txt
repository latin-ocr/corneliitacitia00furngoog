Himseli the most unmilitary of emperors, he owed his imperium to the
soldiers' oath, in which the senate had afterwards acquiesced,· and this

Nor were the character and surroundings oi Claudius favourable to a
permanent realisation of any good ideal oi government, whether personal
or constitutional, supposing him to have honestly contemplated it.
Even the best side ol his secluded lise, his historical study, while it was
in no respect a sufficient substitute ior the great military achievements
and important civil duties which had formed the training of Tiberius,

the assaults of pasquinade and satire. The Roman aristocrats, who
cordially disliled the idea oi admitting the natives oi ‘Gallia comata'
within their ranks, would gladly seize on the abundant ground oi ridicule
aliorded by the rambling eruditiori with which the proposes obscured
rather than illustrated the practical reasons for the change ⁴. The anti·
