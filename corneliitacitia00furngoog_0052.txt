010. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 37

311110 shortlived addition of letters to the alphabet ¹, the affectation of
archaic spelling ¹, the attempt to rescue from deserved decay the obsolete
lore of the 31111ρὶ0011, might 3110 have the satisfaction of pointing out
that their august professor did not after all know the ancient meaning 01
the term ‘libertinus¹,' and had forgotten his own researcbes on the
computation of an Etruscan ‘saeculum 1.’

Α33111, much as we may set down to a conscientious intention to
discharge a public duty, and to a desire of emulating Augustus 1, we
must ascribe also in no small degree to vanity and seli-conceit that
passion for the persoual exercise of judicial functions which all authorities
3110011, and which, notwithstanding the record that many of his decisione
were shrewd and original 1, and that some of the principles of law
embodied in his judgments or legislative enactments are quoted with
approval long afterwards by juristic writers ¹, could not have worked
generally for the public benefit. Even in ordinary cases such encroach·
ment by the princeps in Rome and by his procurators elsewhere ¹⁰ on
the ordinary tribunals was an injudicious weakening of their authority;
nor could all 1110 assiduity 01 Claudius prevent accumulation of arrears
and harassing delays‚ shortened (if we are to believe our authors) by very
summary modes of expedition ¹¹ ; while, in cases involving graver charges,
‘ 3 prince who centred in himself all functions of law and magistracy¹²'
was but calling 11110 existence and enriching acrowd of accusers to whom
condemnations and collusive acquittals 111110 were profitable¹⁸. They
felt they had only to study the humours of a single person, devoid 01
