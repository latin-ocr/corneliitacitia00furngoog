mental equilibrium ¹, deciding without publicity and without appeal, and
subject to opportunities oi domestic pressure beyond anything which
could be applied to even the most subservierit senate ¹. The result is
a general sense oi scandalous injustice, which it is one'oi the most
popular acts oi his successor to remove ⁸.

Nor was it only as an inspired judge or legislator, but also among the
conquerors os the world, that his own vanity or the language oi flatterers
led him to aspire to fill a niche in history. That the British expedition
should be commemorated in magniloquent words and stately memorials,
and by claiming the right, so rarely exercised, to extend the ‘pomerium’⁴,
and that he should consider that his own campaign oi sixteen days⁶
entitled him to the honour oi a iull triumph, was perhaps to be expected:
it is more characteristic oi the man, thatin the space oi some twelve
years he should have twenty-seven times⁶ received the title oi ‘imperator'⁷
ior victories, many of which seem to dely all attempt at identification⁸,
and should have kept up the fiction oi incessant military glories by the
prodigality with which he showered triurnphal distinctions on his sub·
ordinates'. Other qualities resulting equally irorn his antecedents were
still more mischievous.

It was a standing anomaly os the constitution that many offices which
in a modern state would be important departments ol the civil service
were regarded as no more than posts in the chies citizen’s household‚
unworthy oi the dignity oi any person above the ranlr oi a ireedman ¹⁰.
The consequent exaltation oi the importance oi persons oi no recognised
political status, checlied at first by the aristocratic sympathies oi Augustus
and Tiberius ¹¹, and hardly gaining time ior iull growth under Gaius ¹¹,
