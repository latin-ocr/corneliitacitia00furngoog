the same terms as by others3 as one whose unbridled profligacy made
a pastime of the interests ol the state ¹, whose influence was used solely
to exalt her favourites or to destroy those who disdained her adrances,
or in any way crossed her path. Of the ‘many murders perpetrated
at her hidding'2, we may take as a sample the case with which the
Eleventh Book opens, in which, to appense the mere J’ealousy of wanton·
ness and the further promptings ol cupidity, four lives at once are
sacrificedl. It is her will to destroy a rival in the affectione of a
- J, pantomimist, and yet to spare her favourite himself ; and the coreted
possessione of the senator' on whom the charge is shifted make him
all th'e more a weleome victim. Men of the highest rank are ready
ln a moment to effect her purpose; a consular accuser rakes together
all the antecedents of the accused to secure a conviction, and when even
· the intimidation exercised by her own presence⁴ was insufficient to
coerce her husband's judgment, when the graver charges are on the
point of ignominiously breaking down, and the defence had even extorted
some touch oi womanly feeling from herself ¹, the most influential senator
of the day steps in to gratify her still relentless purpose by ensuring
the fate os the accused through a ready stratagem⁸‚ while she herself,
by mere force of threats, terrifies Poppaea into suicide⁷: two eminent
knights are attached by the well-worn artifice ol a dream story, and
condemned by a subservierit senate to complete her vengeance¹3 and
the dotard, who had even forgotten that any charge against Poppaea
existed ⁹, has instilled into him a vindictive hatred of the memory ¹⁰ oi
theman whom, if left to himself, he would have acquitted, and is
persuaded to heap rewards on those who had talren even an insignificant
share in the transaction¹¹.

To such a narrative the only fitting climax is supplied by that of
her last catastrophe; in relating which Tacitus pauses for a moment
to bespeak the readers' credence by an comest protestation that he
has added nothing to the record of his authorities ¹¹. The story as it
stands is indeed oi so astounding a character that it has been thought
that in some of its most important particulars we have an audacibus
