falsehood, resting probably on the memolrs of Agrippina ¹, and that the
true version is that given by Suetonius alone, and by him mentioned
only to be dismissed, that Claudius, in fear of an alleged omen, por-
tending danger to the husband of Messalina, endeavoured to avert it
by becoming a consenting party to her marriage with Silius ². It would
remam to be supposed that Narcissus was still able to compass her
destruction and that of her partisans by turning the emperor’s fear into
another channel, and representing the political dangers⁸ of the alliancc
which, acting no doubt under the advice of his freedmen‚ and probably
of Narcissus himself, he had but just sanctioned. Whether this suppo·
sidon, added to the difficulty of explaining how, in a matter of such
notoriety, so important a circumstance as the previous cognizance of
Claudius could have been effectually concealed from the contemporary
and eminent authorities whom Tacitus has followed, is not even more
incredible than the story handed down to us, is an open question. ln
either case we have the same fine-voven tissue of intrigue; the plot
on foot can only be betrayed by a counterplot; should she once so
much as gain a hearing, all is lost, and the intended victim would
j0in the chief offender in taking vengeance on those who sought to
save him.

Messalina has neither found nor deserved to find apologists ; but there
may be reason to believe that the memoirs of her rival have furnished
exaggeratione of her enormities. It is difficult to believe that so much
wicledness can have been crowded into a married life which seems to
have begun at about the ageos fifteen, and ended at about that of twenty-
three ⁴. Juvenal's terrible description of her worst orgies ⁶, though not
uncorroborated by other writers ⁸, is yet neither supported by the hostile
Seneca ⁷, nor by what is extant of Tacitus. To some such extent alone
