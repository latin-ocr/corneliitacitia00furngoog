(ιω. 111.] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 43

have we the means of criticising the unanimous testimony which has
covered her name with infamy.

The guilty wile is no sooner in her grave than her successor comesto
the front, and supplies a dominant influence for the remainder of this rule.
By her lineage, higher than that of even Messalina or Claudius ¹, she
would bring as her dower an accession of strength even to a prince ; and
few women had learnt so much from the schooling of vicissitudes. ln
her thirteenth year she had been passively given in marriage¹ to one
whose character was said to be as detestable⁸ as his rank was exalted3
at her widowhood‚ in her twenty-fifth year, she is found ‘prostituting
herself to Lepidus in the hope ol empire⁴,’ sent into exile, stripped of
property, separated from her twoyears' old son. Restored to position
at her uncle's accession ⁸, and further enriched by a subsequent marriage
and widowhood·, she begins a new career of ambition‚ binding the
wealthiest freedman to her interest by unscrupulous profligacy⁷‚ and
winning for her son a prominence which had nearly eost their lives⁸.

In causing the fall of her rival she may probably have taken no part’ ;
but in the intrigue of which the palace again becomes the focus she
throws her own blandishments into the scale ιο; and, if we are to believe
our authorities, the incestuous marriage was won by previous incest ¹¹.

Nor was she to be satisfied with the position of an emperor's wile ;
she would be all, and more than all, that Livia had been to Augustus,
and govern the Roman world under the shadow ofa feeble husband or a
stripling son. In the words ol Tacitus ¹², ‘all power centred in awoman;
but the reins of bondage were now drawn with a firm ‘and masculine
hand: there was all outward show of decorum, and often dignity, and
such immorality alone as served her interests ’; and the domestic history
of the remaining years is little more than a record of the stages by which
