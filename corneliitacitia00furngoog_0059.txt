she advaueed her own position and that os her son ¹. She amasses
wealth first and loremost¹; for in that age every man had his price:
the recall and advnncement of Seneca³ gives her the popular position ol
a protectress oi culture ⁴, and the most brilliant writer and most versatile
politician os the day as her ally. Above all, she takes care to secure a
lar stronger interest, by obtaining the command ol the praetorians sor
her nominee ⁵. The ontward marks oi ascendancy come in due course.
She is the first emperor's wile to receive the title ol ‘Augusta’ ⁶, the first
whose name is J'oined with his on the coinage ⁷, the first woman alter
whom a colony is named ⁸: at the pageant of Caractacus⁰ and the open-
ing ol the tunnel oi Lake Fucinus ¹⁰, she sits as the emperor’s equal at
his side. ln the caseos Vitellius ¹¹, she showed her power to protect her
partisans, in those os Lollia Paulina ¹², and os Calpurnia ¹⁸, her power to
destroy real or possible rivals; and, while pushing the popularity oi her
son¹⁴, and reserving what duties were odious lor her husband ¹⁵, she
appeared willing to let the realization ol her final aims wait on the course
oi nature. But new dangers guthered round her path. Besides a power·
ful hostile party in the senate ²⁸, Narcissus, a deadly enemy, neither to be
reconciled nor supplanted, was at the emperor's side, and was organising
a fresh intrigue ¹⁷ with the same steady purpose which had struck down
Messalina in the plenitude oi her power. He had personally nothing
to hope from Britannicus, whom he had probably joined with others in
supplanting ¹⁸3 but he was menaced by still more imminent danger from
Agrippina and her son: while Claudius lived he was saie, and it was
only on the latter side that the lise oi Claudius was threatened ¹⁸. Hence
he bent all his energy to undo the past, to restore the emperor's
affection sorbis son by blood, and to destroy the intrudens. Agrippina's
first attempt to attacli him through the sailure of the Fucinus tunnel²⁰ had
evidently sailed, and his prompt countercharge¹¹ had probably lodged
