estimate ¹, have called him imbecile on the strength 01 such fallings
as he hardly cares to notice, such as his pedantry and vanity ¹, or even
the absurd inequality and absence ol all dignity and proportion in his
edicta and other public utterances'. The justification 01 such a term
is ratberto be found in his unconsciousness 01 patent facts going on
around him, his apathy, weakness ol will and purpose, readiness to be
swayed by those who had the last word with him, qualities by no means

That his nature was to some extent always such, Tacitus undoubtedly,
