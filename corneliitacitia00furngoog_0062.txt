enar. tlh] RULE OF CLAUDIUS. 47

governors are not seldom sent even to the most important provinces,
as Didius to Britain ¹, Quadratus to Syria'; and no less his own
astonishing ignorance of, or indifferencc to, the immorality of his wife¹,
and the scandalous traffic‘ of which the colossal fortunes amassed by
his freedmen was patent evidence, must be held to go far to bear
out the charge against him. It is probably also in the later period
that the alleged Judicial scandalsl, so far as they are well founded,
must be placed; and ii the account of the trial of Asiaticus is to be
believed, any other such cases are probable. The story of his abject
prostration during the crisis of Messalina and Silius must have been
known to many¹ and cannot well he a fabrication; and the description
of his state of mind during the intrigues for his subsequent marriage ¹,
though testing, no doubt, on private sources only, derives credit from
what was plainly matter of public record, his speech to the praetoriana.
emphatically renouncing all idea of matrimony⁸, the immediate sequence
of a decree to enable him to marry Agrippina ¹, and the extraordinary
reasons announced by him for his selection ¹⁰.

After this marriage, under the influence of a more imperious will, he
is still further effaced, and appears to originate nothing.. He does his
wife's hidding in all that tends to advance herself and her son, and
in destroying the last safeguards that surround Britannicus ¹¹. He moves
a law, and expressly assigns the credit of it to Pallas ¹²3 he proposes a
gift of indemnity, expressly as a boon to his physician Xenophon ¹³.
Otherwise, his chief function is to condemn and punish ¹⁴, which appears
to have been no uncongenial taslr to him. For it is his cruelty, far
more than any other quality, that has left an indelible stain upon his
character ¹¹, and requires as its most lenient explanation the supposition
of such callous apathy as is the natural outcome of imbecility. The
number of his victims is made to reach a formidable total of all ranks
and classes ¹⁴5 and wc have hideous tales of the levity with which he
