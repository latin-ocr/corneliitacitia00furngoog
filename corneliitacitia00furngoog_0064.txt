Our history of this prince in Tacitus is on the whole as complete
as that of Tiberius: in both some notice is given of the previous
life, and a full history is preserved of the greater part of the rule; in
both an important portion is lost to us which is ill made up by what
cau be gleaned from other sources. In tbe case of Nero, the fact that
the lost portion includes the end involves also the loss of any general
judgment which the historiari may have thought fit to give by way
of summary.

united a descent on his mother's side from Octavia to the high lineage
of bis paternal family ¹, and who afterwards narrowly escaped peril of his
life by the opportune death of Tiberius ². His son, originally named
Lucius Domitius, was born at Antium on Dec. 15, 790, au. 37³, and
he himself died of a dropsy at Pyrgi about two years later ⁴. His death

Gaius had seized’, the boy was further enriched by that of his step-
