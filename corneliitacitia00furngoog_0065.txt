by Messalina as scared away by tutelary serpents⁵. The sympathy
enlisted by this and other such devices, manifesting itself in an unmis·
takeable preponderance ol applause in favour oi the grandson oi
Germanicus on his first public appearance with his younger rival
Britannicus in the ‘ludus Trojae' at the secular gamesl, would naturally
have increased his danger, had not Messalina been turned from her
schemen of vengeance by the keener passion⁷ which in the next year
impelled her to her death.
