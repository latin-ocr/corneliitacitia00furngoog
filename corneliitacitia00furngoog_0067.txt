52 INTRODUCTION. [cm. ru.

L. Silanus²: a year later (803, nn. 50), Pallas persuades bis patron
with equal lacility that the adoption of the already designated son-inlavv
is recommended by precedent and policy¹3 and L. Domitius at twelve
years old pesses over the head of Britannicus as Nem Claudius Caesar.
ln the following year³ he is pushed on before the usual time to assume
the toga virilis, and steps at once into the position oia recognised
successor as ‘princeps iuventutis,' is designated to receive the consulship
in his twentieth year, and at once to hold ‘proconsulare imperium'
everywhere except within the walls of Rome, and to become member
os all the great priestly collegas ⁴. The auspicious event is com-
memorated by largess to soldiers and people, and the heir is paraded
at the votive gamas in the state dress of a magistrate. Two years later
(806, ab· 53) the betrothal of lour years’ standing is crowned by
marriage; and the prestige ol his culture is sustalned by a series oi
orations, composed no doubt by the instructor, but gracelully delivered
by the pupil, in a vein oi popular generosity‚ to obtain privileges or
subventione lor various communitiesl. We may suppose also that
during this period, it vas not lorgotten in his interest, that he had
independent claims, irrespective ol his adoption by Claudius, to be
treated as the direct and true representative oi the Julian Caesars⁸.
The succession could hardly seem to be ln doubt⁷3 and the posi-
tion ol Nero had to all appearance more to gain than to lose by
time; but Britannicus, however studiously ellaced, paraded in a childish
‘praetexta' to point the contrast to his rival’s robe ⁸, and given in
charge, on the preterit os a rash jest, to guardians chosen by his
stepmother’ and altogether laitbless¹⁰‚ had yet his partisans; and the
threatened counterplot ol Narcissus ¹¹, in an indirect issue ol which,
the trial ol Domitia Lepida, Nero gave the first prool olbis callous
