heartlessness by appearing as a witness to compass the death of
one who had loaded his life with indulgences ¹, brought about the cata·

than three years by their praefect ¹, and already tampered with ⁸, were
not slow to earn their donative⁴3 the legions had been probably se-

sitting of the senate had confirmed the youth, who still wanted two

In his sltetch ol the rule of Nem, Tacitus has plainly intended each
Book to constitute a period ς and of these, that included in the Thirteenth
Book. comprising the fragment ol 807, aa. 54, and the four complete

power ⁹, she might have succeeded in the comparatively easy taslr ol
moulding her young son to her will ; and to any less imperious nature,
the outward show of dignity granted her would have been ample. ‘The
best of ιιιοιιιιειεἰο was the first watchword given by Nero to the prae·
torians; the honours awarded to Livia at the death of Augustus were
again repeated ¹¹, and additions made to them. Her image appears on
the coinage of her son ¹⁸, as before on that of her husband ¹³3 the Arval
