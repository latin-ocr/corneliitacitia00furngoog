ior a time the title ol ‘pater patriae'¹; ‘when 1 shall have deserved it,’
is his answer declining a vote ol thanlrs¹; other extravagant compliments
are refused³; nor will he permit his first colleague in the consulship
to swear to his ‘acta' ⁴; the first honours lor which he makes request
are to the memory oi his lather, and to the services os his former
guardianl. His liberality is shown in magnificent gilas to friends ⁰, in
the donativo to the soldiers ⁷, the unusually large congiarium to the
people⁸, the remissiora ol burdens⁹, also in a subvention, perhaps to
remedy past maladministration, to the public treasury ¹⁰. Above all, he
is to win renown by princely clemency: and speech upon speech are
composed sor him ¹¹, set to the strain oi the writers famous treatise¹¹;
while their sincerity is attested by repression ol delations ¹³, by acquistals ¹⁴,
mitigation or remissiori ol sentences ¹⁵3 so that whatever credit was due
in this respect to the age ol Augustus, or the first period os Tiberius,
pales before the glory ol a prince¹⁸ who exclaims ‘would that I could
neither read nor write,' when a death-warrant lies belore him lor

called into action by the turn ol affairs in the East, as elsewhere
described ¹⁸. lt is sufficient here to note that both in vigour ol action
and definiteness ol purpose, an emphatic contrast was shown to the
wealrness and corruption ol the previous period; and that the whispered
misgivings ol adverse critics¹⁹ were not only silenced by the appointment
os Corbulo, but swept away ina torrent ol extravagant compliments
awarded by the senate belore a blow was struck ²⁰.
