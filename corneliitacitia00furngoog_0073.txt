Elsewhere, our only record oi foreign or provincial affairs is that
better appointmeuts seem to be made, and imperial interests seem more
cared sor than under the later Claudian rule. Veranius from whom
much was expected, succeeds Didius in Britain, and on his speedy death
is succeeded at the close os this period by Suetonius Paulinus¹; a new
legatus oi Lower Germany takes prompt action against occupatione oi
territory previously overlooked¹ ; acorrupt practice by which provincial
governors managed to win condonation ior their iniquities by indulging
their people with gladiatorial shows, is forbidden ³.

As regards the home govemment, while the senate is encouraged
to the discharge of the duties left to it ⁴, the supersession of so many
ol its functione and those os its magistrates, by procuratore and other
imperial officers, continues as under the Claudian system³; andan
important further step is taken towards withdrawing the public treasury
from senatorial control by placing it under praefecti, who, though
senators ol high rank, were the emperor’s officers ⁸. But the general
reaction against Claudian venality and corruption is emphasized by
the dismissal os Pallas ², and appointment oi a successor whose qualities
made him long acceptable⁸. The same spirit is manifested in the
onslaught on the extortions ol the ‘publicani' an occasion memorable
lor the impulsive proposal recorded as directly originated by Ner0, to
abolish ‘vectigalia’ generally ⁹. 1t we are to suppose the measure
contemplated to have been really as sweeping as Tacitus has conceived
it to be¹⁰, and that the young emperor had any real comprehensioni
os its scope ¹¹, and any deliberate idea ol establishing universal iree
trade throughout the empire, and leaving its whole income to be
levied by direct tribute on the provincial subjeets, we must see in it
the first and most striking assertion oi apurpose, more or less present
in all his extravagances, oi ruling by popular support; the goodwill
aimed at in this case being that of Roman citizens everywhere, who paid
no tribute, though contributing with all others to the ‘vectigalia' His
