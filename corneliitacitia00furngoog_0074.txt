cm. ru] RULE OF NERO.

advisers, while prudently dissuading him from this headlong impulse,
encouraged no doubt, and probably prompted, his bids for popularity
in other directions, such as the largesses already mentioned ¹, the assign-
ment of public land to veterane to recruit the decaying population of
Italian towns¹, the confidence shown in the populace by the withdrawal
of tbe guard from the theatre ⁸, the erection of a new amphitheatro for
the favourite amusement of the city ⁴.

Sustained by such measures, and by the renown and victories of
Corbulo, the new government was no doubt winning golden opinions
on every side; and it is probably to this combination of an energctic
and successful foreign policy with an outwardly upright and popular
home govemment, that these years of Nero owe the emphatic encomium
given them by his great successor Trajan, as a period with which no
other since the foundation of the principate could stand comparisont
To those who study the history as we have it, such high praise is
hard to justify; nor would it seem as if Tacitus meant us to regard
it as more than a period in which evil tendencies were kept somewhat
in check, or skilfully concealed ⁸.

Such aview becomes eminently tme‚ if we look at the development
during this period of Nero’s own character3 of which even the best
side stood in startling contrast to any ideal of a Roman autocrat.
Youth might indeed excuse mere frivolity, such as that which made
him at once on becoming princeps place himself under the instruction
of the great harper of the day ⁷, fly from the taslr of composing his
own speechcs and edicts', and spend his time in a round of emateur
attempts at engraving, pointing, singing, driving, varied at intervals
by lits of verse-making’. Yet, even this would wear a graver aspect,
as men got to know that some of these pursuits had taken such hold
on him, that his one ambition, restrained as yet by' his mother’s
influence, wasto exbibit his talent in public ¹⁰. Still more ominous
was it to hear that the ruler of the Roman world roamed the streets
alter dark with a band of rioters, wounding and beating quiet people,
and turning the night into a scene of pillage¹¹; that a young man of
