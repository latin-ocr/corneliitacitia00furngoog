cm. 110] RULE oF NERO. 61

It was again within this period, iu the fourth year 01 his rrrle ¹, that a
new and overpowen'ng influence took hold 01 him, that of the beautiful
aud abandoned woman who, adding judicious 0010000Ι 10 consummate
profligacy, and combining in herself the characters of the intriguer ⁸, the
wit⁴, the devotee⁸, and the fatalist‘, was enabled during the seven
remaining years 01 101 life to keep a firm hold on his 0110011000 ⁷, and
to lead him 00 from crime to crime.

The remainder 01 this sketcb will deal rather with distinet subjecte
than successive periods, and show the way in which various parts 01 his
character unfolded themselves. One such subject is almost completed in
the Fourteenth Book, which begins with oue and ends with another 01
the two great atrocities 01 his domestic 111 .

With regard to the first 01 these, the graphio narrative 01 Tacitus is
confirmed in its main points by other writers, though 101 much 01 the
detail and nearly all the antecedent circumstances he is 0111 sole
authority.

It would be an error to suppose that when the stmggle 101 political
ascendancy had been decided against her, and the show no less than the
substance 01 regency had vanished⁸, Agrippina was no longer a force ’
10 be reckoned with. At what seemed then the crisis 01 her fate, a single
interview with her son had so worked upon him as to change the whole
face of the situation⁹3 and even as the breach went on widening, the
habit 01 submission to that terrible will had become such second nature,
that Nero never dared 10 indulge his longing 10 0111111111 himself on the
stage ¹⁰. Poppaea again could feel that never, while Agrippina lived,
could she hope 10 become Nero’s wife ²¹, and that he could easier be led
to compass her death than to deiy her openly. So she plies him with all
the weapons 01 sarcasm, reproach, lamentation, tendsrness ¹², herself well
