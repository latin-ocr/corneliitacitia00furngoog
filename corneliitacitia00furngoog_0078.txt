Seneca¹ by senate ⁴, people³ and provinces⁴; till at last aller linger·
ing months in Campania⁴, reassured by the encouragement os the
crew of villains who are already represented as surrounding him ⁴,
and heralding his return by the ostentatione pardon of some of his
mother's victims⁴, he comes back in a kind ol royal progress⁴, cele-
brating in the Capitol what is described as his triumph over the en·
slaved conscience os Rome ⁹, and relieving his mind by plunging into
dissipation.

The facts ol the story, with the exception of some details ¹⁰, are not
questioned. It is more to the purpose to ask whether any ground os
imperious state necessity, any genuine belief that ‘either she or Nero had
to perish¹¹,' can be alleged to palliate the deed Lawless and daring as
she was, possessed of unbounded wealth¹⁴‚ with the praetoriana at least so
lar for her as not to be counted on to act against her¹³; it might seem
that the keys os a revolution lay within her grasp On the other hand,
she knew that by success she would only enter on a new phase ol
danger, and that whoever she had set in Nero's place would be lirst to
regard her as too formidabis to live ¹⁴. Her hest delence is lound in the
indictment laid belore the senate ¹⁴, in which we may be sure that the
ingenuity os Seneca had raked together all that rested on a tittle ol lact
or could anyhow be made to seem credible. We are referred back to
her attempta to assume a regency, to her vindictive endeavours to retaliate
on the nobles, soldiers, and people who had relused to swear allegiance
to her ¹⁴; her misdeeds as wile ol Claudius are thrown into the scale Π3
but as against her son, beyond the silly tale os Agerinus and his dagger¹⁴‚
not a word is laid to her charge. As a set off ιο the infamy which
