him and Burms of being cognisant of the plot beforehand, a charge
doubtfully made ¹, unsupported by evidence, and in itself improbable.
Men of that age and experience would hardly have caught at the
suggestion os the freedman‚ to get up a sham shipwreck on a calm night
in the bay of Baiae.

Thus died Agrippina, at the early age of forty·three ¹, at the bidding
of the son lor whom her greatest crimes were perpetrated, aller having
been for ten years the most prominent woman up to that date in all
Roman history. It may seem a fitting retribution that one who had
so blackened other reputations by her memoirs⁸ should have the load
of her own sins aggravated by falsehood, and that the greatest known
intriguer should have been the victim ol counter-intrigue 3 nor has any-
thing but the atrocity os her murder won sympathy for one whose end
was otherwise but a fitting climax to her lile.

It excites surprise that lull three years should have intervened before
the murder ol Agrippina was followed by the divorce of Octavia and
⁶ marriage of Poppaea. But few qualities are more remarkable in Nero
than his timidity‚ and the manner in which he felt his way from crime
to crime, as if to ascertain gradually how far he could salely venture.
In the present case, the realisation of his own chief longing‚ the public
exhibition of his accomplishments, though tentative and gradual‚ yet in
some form began at once; but the elevation of Poppaea from mis-
tress to lawful wife, an object ol far more interest to her than to
himself, was so delayed as to make her fear that she had intrigued
in vain. It was not till his shy, quasi-private appearance as a cha·
rioteer in his gardens⁴ had been succeeded by his entry on the stage
at the Juvenalia⁵‚ not till the adverse munnurs at the institution
os the Neronia⁶ had been somewhat silenced by the experience of
it⁷‚ not till the opportune death of Burrus had placed the command
of the praetorians in safer ha'nds', and Seneca had retired with
shattered influence into half privacy⁹‚ not till the dangerous Rubellius
Plautus had followed Sulla into exile ¹⁰ and both had after an in·
terval been put to death ¹¹, not till he saw these and all his other
atrocities regarded as matters of public admiration and enthusiastic
rejoicing ¹¹, that he had courage to turn over another page in his
domestIc history ¹³.
