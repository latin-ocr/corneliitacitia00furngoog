66 INTRODUCTION. [cmi. 111.

Some three years more¹ sufficed ior the career ol Poppaea, and to
close with it Nero’s domestic history. At the birth oi her child, she was
raised to the rank of Livia and Agrippina by receiving the title ol
Augusta², nor did she during her remaining short time outlive her
influence3 and Nero, it, as was supposed, he had caused her death
by a passionate blow ⁸, was none the less sincere in deploring it. Men
knew well enough that her wantonness had been equalled by her 116611-
less cruelty⁴3 yet Thrasea alone ventured to protest by his 1111161166ὖ
against the extravagance oi her funeral honours⁶ and the deification that
followed⁷. Her place was soon filled by Statilia Messalina ⁸, who is
not known to have exercised any influence on Nero, and may be dis·
missed from mention.

Hardly less important than the horrors of his domestic tite, in their
effect on Roman sentiment, were the van'ous public displays ol his
unbounded vanity. Their repression under bis mother's influence has
been already noticed’3 and even aiter her death Seneca and Burms
were able ior a while to modify what they could not hinder. The first
attempt, in 812, an. 59, to satisfy one only ol his longings, and
that by a mere private exhibition in his gardens ¹⁰, achieved only a
nominal success; the limitation to a lew favoured spectators soon
passing on to the permitted, afterwards to the invited presence ol all
the many who cared, and the many more who lelt compelled to pretend
to care, to see the charioteering of an emperor ¹¹. His other leading
taste was in the same year partially gratified by the device 61 a festival,
which, by its exceptional and quasi-family character ¹¹, might seem to
excuse not only the licentious revelry ol its surroundings¹⁸, but even his
own ‘debut' as a scenis musician, and the strange incongruity of a
harper appearing on the stage, not only with a ‘elaqueur' band 61
Roman knights ¹⁴ in the audience, but even with his guard 61 soldiers and
