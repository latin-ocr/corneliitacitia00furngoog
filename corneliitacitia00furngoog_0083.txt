to the voice oi the people‚ come forward with a show of reluctance, barp
in hand, scrupulously observing the minutest rules oi professional
etiquette‚ making bis obeisance to the demoralised assemblage‚ and
trembting, or affecting to tremble, before his judges ¹. We are, shown
the contrast oi the drilled and disciplined applause‚ and vehasumed,
if not genuine enthusiasm of *bis great clientele, the Roman-noble&
with the ill-concealed contempt oi the municipal, provincial, and. other
respectable sections of the audience, who had to bear the blows ol the
soldiers at one moment ior slackness‚ at another ior ill-timed clapping.
We have the higher classes, not daring to be absent, some crushed
to death in the prees, some struck down in their seats by diseases
arising irom exhaustion, with every look oi weariness and disgust noted
down by spies and sure to be sooner or later resented, and Vespasian
scolded by 4 [reedman ior nodding in slumber, and brought into such
peril as well-nigh to baulk his destiny.

It must be borne in mind that, side by side with the genuine and
righteous feeling os disgust at this degradation os imperial 'majesty
repeating on a greater scale and in more maniioid forms theextrava-
gances oi Gaius ⁸, was a less creditable current oi old Roman prejudice
against Greek amusements ⁴. This is seen in sull strength· in the
murmurs at the institution oi the ‘Neronia⁸', where Tacitus ireely
admits that the iorce os argument was not wholly on one side ⁶, and
that the gloorny anticipatione were not justified by the result ⁷. At a
time when the old national military exercises, invidiously contrasted '
with the palaestra ⁸, must have been growing more and more obsoletae,
we can see that the best minds should have welcorned, on the score
oi humanity and retinement, any counterattraction to that of the amphi-
theatre 3 but the feeling above noted is certainly a force to be estimated,
as also the dismay selt at the rusb of the Roman nobility to hire them·
selves out ior the stage, the circus, or the arena Such precedents as
had already existed' must have served only to set oli a contrast in
