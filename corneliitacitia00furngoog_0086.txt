leadership of Thrasea, showed that the extreme sentence os death had
been expected ¹. Even a lower class would be alarmed by the current
belief ¹ that in tbe same year the once all-powerful Pallas and another
leading freedman had fallen victims respectively to the emperor’s avarice
and animosity ⁸.

Thus all in prominent positione would feel that they were drifting back
into a similar condition ol constraint and jeopardy to that which had
prevailed under former princes, and that while their danger increased‚ their
saleguards one by one were struck from thern ⁴. The death oi Burrus,
in which again foul play was commonly believed to have had a share ⁶,
took place in the same year which so many eventa combined to make
ominous⁸; and in the same year Seneca, isolated by this loss, and, by
evident decay of influence, marked out sor the attacks oi those who wished
him ill ⁷, could only avert his danger by a prompt offer to surrender all
his property ⁸, and hya cautious withdrawal from all outward show oi
eminence⁸ ; so that men had no longer to reckon on the influence os
these trusted counscllors, bnt on that of Tigellinus and Poppaea.

On minda thus prepared to expect and believe the worst‚ terrible im-
pression must have been made by the great lire ol 817, nn. 64, and by
the rnmours that Nero himself had been its author. From thia imputa·
tion, which Tacitus alone ol our authorities treats as even open to doubt¹⁰,
the judgment of recent critice has beenon the whole disposed to absolve
his memory. The improbability of the motives assigned ¹¹, his absence
at the outbreak ¹¹, the energetic mensures taken by the government for its
suppression ¹⁸, the bounty shown to the sufferers ¹⁴, weigh considerably
