againsta suspicion so slenderly supported ¹. The belief itself was less
an impulse of the moment¹ than an aller-growth⁸, gathering strength no
doubt from the stories that he had pillaged the ruins ⁴, and from the
patent lact that he had seized all the best of the vast desolaled area to
' construet a palace on a scale previously unknown save perhaps in
Oriental history. The famous expedient by which this suspicion wasto
be averted by fastening it on others, is treated of elsewhere ⁵: our judg-
ment on Nero's own share in it will depend much on whether we believe
him to have been himself the incendiary, and deliberately to have sacri·
liced those whom he had the best reason for knowing to be innocent, or
to have been, like others, in the darlr as to the real cause of the fire, and
to have believed tales which represented the Christians either as actually
its authors, or as, from their ‘hatred of the human race ¹ ⁶, lilrely to have
been so. In any case, history must record against him the recldess
eagemess with which the charge was caught up, and the fiendish brutality
which turned the executione into a public amusement, such as shocked
even the hardened sense os those whose misgivings were to have been set
at rest by it ⁷.

To such ample reasons for alarm and indignation ⁸, other grounds ol
discontent were contributing strength. The military disaster in Britain
and disgrace in the East⁸ may have shaken the allegiance of the soldiers
to a prince who had little personal hold upon them, and whose star
seemed no longer in the ascendant: the popularity of Nero with the massas
must have received a checlr from the strong feeling at his enforcement
of the cruel decree against the slaves of Pedanius Secundus ¹⁰, and from
the enthusiastic sympathy with Octavia ¹¹, and could be further under-
mined by keeping alive the belief ¹² that the catastrophe which had cost
