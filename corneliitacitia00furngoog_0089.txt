who might strike out a line of his own when the crisis came ¹. In the
light of what had followed ou the death of Gaius, none would be so
short-sighted as not to reckon with the praetorians3 hut the accession of
the praefect Faenius Rufus, who was quaking under the insinuatione of
his colleague Tigellinus ², seemed a tower of strength to them, and the
support of several other important officers of the force, backed by
a liberal donative, might do the rest ³. That the last word still would
rest with the armies of Germsny and the East‚ who were little likely to
accept a master whom they had no voice in choosiug, was a truth that
perhaps needed to be taught hy a later experience ⁴.

Tacitus has shown the reality of the plot, against the popular rumour
which discredited it asa fiction ⁶ ; and for all its details he is practically
our sole authority ⁶. Nero and bis partisaus must indeed have believed
in his destiuy, when they saw how, after the plot had been kept for two
years secret ⁷, and had even escaped the danger caused hythe indiscretion
of Epicharis ⁸, it was brought to light the very day before it was to have
been carried into action ⁹3 how Piso tamely threw away the one chance
left to him ¹⁰ ; how, when Nero was surrounding himself with soldiers in
bis panic ¹¹, ignorant of the traitors among their ranks ¹², the baseness with
which they turned upon their associates frustrated another chance of his
destruction ¹⁸, and led them also to the fate they had so justly merited¹⁴.

We have probably to be on our guard throughout against statements
heightened for eflect¹⁸. The contrast of freeborn men, Roman knights,
senators, rushing to save themselves by denouncing their dearest friends
and relatives, with the freedwomsn who alone defied the rack to conceal
those almost unknown to her, may possibly be overdrawn ¹⁶5 the general
