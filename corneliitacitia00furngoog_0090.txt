cun. ιιι] RULE OF NERO. 75

description of Rome in a state ol siege, ‘the very sea aud river placed
under guard '; armed men pervading the fora, the great houses, even the
suburban districts ¹ ; the ‘troops ol chained prisoners' dragged to trial ²,
and the crowd ol funerals in the streets³, cannot easily be reconciled with
the names and lactc given in detail ⁴: even the terrible irony ol universal
public thanltsgiving side by side with universal private monning, may
well be taken with some allowance sor rhetoric ’ς but the main narrative,
both in what lt states, and no less in what it does not state ⁶, bears the
stamp ol truth upon it.

Our chief interest in the Pisonian conspiracy lies in its having caused
the deaths of Seneca and Lucan. As regards the complicity ol the
former ⁷, his standing intimacy with Piso, and recent withdrawal from
personal intercourse ⁸, would suggest that he was aware os the plot but
declined to mix in it; his removal irom Campania to the neighbourhood
ol Rome at the critical time may bave been a coincidence⁰; his alleged
answer to Piso’s message rests on the verbal report of a single witness
threatened with torture ¹⁰, and was neither admitted by himself ¹¹, nor
unmistalteable in meaning ¹². His thorough knowledge of Nero,
Poppaea, and Tigellinus may well have predisposed him to welcome any
escape lrom them; while on the other hand his political loresight, no less
than bis age, and the retirement of lile which he had found so welcome¹',
