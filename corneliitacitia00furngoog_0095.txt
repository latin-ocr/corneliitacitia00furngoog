80 INTRODUCTION. [cm. 111.

Many oi the conspirators, andos those who perished subsequently,
had few claims, or none whatever, on general sympathy ; and even the
highest ranked in elevation ol character below Thrasea and Soranus,
to whose iate Tacitus has given more space than to that of any others
among the Neronian victims ¹. Yet, with all that is toldus, much is still
leil obscure and unexplained; and the real causes which led Nero to
compass their destruction are mainly matter oi conjecture.

Thrasea, though undoubtedly the leader of the extreme section of the
senatorial ‘Opposition'¹, and a man oi longstanding and pronounced
republican sympathies, had been enabled, although a ‘novus homo'
from Patavium ³, to go through the course of magistracies and attain the
consulship ⁴, and could not therefore have been always obnoxious to
emperors. In the early years of Nero, when his attendance in the
senate was constant ⁶, various servile motions had elicited from him
no word of protest ⁸, and those who had expected greater things had
murmured at the waste of his strength on trifles⁷3 while even his one
strong step, that os rising and leaving the house when thanksgivings and
congratulations were decreed on Agrippina's death ⁸, receives scant
praise from Tacitus⁰. Three years later, at the trial os Antistius ¹⁰, he
appears as a skiliul laeticiam leading the maj0rity of the senate in a
course opposed to Nero's secret purpose, but fully within the terms of
the questionu, and vellinghis opposition under well-chosen compliments¹¹ ;
while his only subsequent recorded speech ¹⁸, is conceived in a nanow
spirit ol Roman pride, could yet have been in no way unacceptable to the
court ¹⁴. lt would seem likely that he had been driven into more pro-
nounced hostility by the aseendancy of Poppaea, and that his three years
of continuous absence from his place in the senate ¹⁵ bad begun at the
date of the vows and thanlrsgivings at the birth oi her child ¹⁸. It is
