cm. ιιι] RULE OF NERO.

cerminly at that date that we find the first open markos Nero’s dis·
pleasure¹, which, though followed immediately by an outward show os
reconciliation, must have leit a sting behind in both minda ². After this,
again sor three years we hear no more3 and then, without any additional
circumstances to explain it, the attaclr is launched uponshirn, beginning
with an invective by his old enemy Capito Cossutianus ⁸, followed bya
emund prohibition from the emperors presence, and a dignified demand
on his part to know the charge against him, which is answered by an
instant summons of the senate to despatch the trial ⁴.

No charge whatever oi the most remote or indirect complicity ln the
Pisonian or any other conspiracy is ever alleged or hinted⁵2 dereliction
oi public duties, an clionee never bciore made the subiect ol a capital
charge or criminal prosecution oi any ltind ⁸, is all that the accusers have
tc gc upon i, or that the emperor evenglances at in his rescript to the
senate⁸; therentio mere inflaticn of rhetoric. The orators are carelul
to point out how important, and how closely touching the emperor per·
sonally, were some of the occasions on which he had been absent, such
aa the solemn vows and ratification os ‘acta' at the beginning ol' each
year ⁹, the vote of divine honours to Poppaea, the attendance on her
tirneral ¹⁰, the trials of Silanus and Anteius ²¹3 nor do they fail to note that
not senatmial duties alone had been thus contemptuously avoided; that
in the college nithe ‘quindecimviri' at the olierings ior the preservation
ol the prince and lor his ‘divine voice ’ ¹¹, Thrasea’s absence bad been no
less conspicuous; even an old story oi want oi heartiness at the ‘Juve-
nalia’ is throwm in ²³3 and on this slender foundation the elaborate fabric

oi a charge oi treason and impiety is built up ¹⁴. Still more remarkable
is the way in which his sou-inlaw Helvidius Priscus, and his fnends
Paconius Agrippinus and Curtius Montanus are thrown in with him, ap·
parently at the last moment, and on charges yet more flimsyu. The first
