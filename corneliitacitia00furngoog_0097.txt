is vaguely described as ‘sharing his madness,' the secorm as ‘the
hereditary enemy of princes,' the third as author of ‘ detestable verses,' of
which no further account is given ¹. That these had followed Thrasea's
course of abstinence from public life is nowhere stated3 and it must be
inserted that their private and personal connection with him is the only
real ground of their association in the charge.

We are thus led to suppose that in Nero's present suspicions mood the
existence of such a coterie seemed in itself to be dangerous. Consider-
able in numbers, and comprising persons of the highest political and
social standing ², it lived in isolation; much as France has seen Legiti-
mists, Bonapartists, or Republicans living in an inner world of their own
under a hostile govemment. With probably no more belief that any
restoration of the Republic was possible, than we have seen it to be likely
that Lucan had⁸‚ they yet consecrated their lives to its memory ; they kept
high festival on the birthdays of Cassius and the Bruti 4; their leader was
himself the biographer of Cato ⁶, and had married the daughter and
namesake of the heroic Αιιίιιο 3 his utterances were to them a fountain
of inspired wisdom ⁷ ; nor was he unwilling to take them into his counsel,
whether to explain his past⁸ or to gulde his future course⁹5 while out-
side themselves no opinion deserved to be taken into account. Strong
governments have found their wisdom in tolerating such bodies, and even
in respecting them; but in the course of terrorism on which Nero was
now launched, it was easy to persuade him thatin dealing with such
opinions, he could not stop at the banishment oi Cassius ¹⁰.

Other difficulties are raised by the attack on Soranus, which, while
simultaneous, and apparently concerted with that on Thrasea ¹¹, comes
from altogether distinct accusers and rests on different charges ¹². He
had certainly not been always in opposition: fourteen years previously,
he had courted Claudius and Pallas by moving a decree of money and
honours to the latter ¹³ ; nor had he ever afterwards taken any part in the
senate which Tacitus has cared to menti0n; noris he stated to have been
