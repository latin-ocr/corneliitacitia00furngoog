It had not generally been regarded as politically dangerons, though it
had numbered individual victims under the empire', and though their
reverence of Cato would associate itself with his cause, however remote
the constitution for which he had died might be from any ideal common·
wealth. But now that Lucan had undoubtedly conspired, and Seneca
and Musonius Rufus⁸ were supposed to have done so, it was easy for
Tigellinus to remind his master of the warning which he had given him
against Rubellius Plautus, ‘that he was of that arrogant sect which made
rnen sedition-mongers and busybodies⁴.' Such arr assertion is indeed in
strange contrast to the philosophie theory, whereby not only was good
govemmentwelcomed by the sage as leaving him free for the higher life ⁵,
but even bad government was not held to call upon him for a hopeless
struggle against it⁸; his state was the universe, and in that alone could he
truly busy himself 7; he would submit freely and willingly to that to which
he must submit anyhow ⁸, unless his position became such as to justify
suicide ⁰. It was thus, as has been well said, ‘not a stimulus to action,
but a consolation under inactivity¹⁰;' and the attitude inculcated, whatever
we may think of itin the light of Seneca’s practice, was altogether in
accordance with that of Thrasea. But under a reign of terror, when to
be conspicuous is to be dangerous, worse arguments have been known to
pass muster against an obnoxious citizen: Rubellius had been an object
of fear, and Soranus was his friend and follow-Stoic: Thrasea’s every
loolr and gesture, imitated by his sourfaced crew, was intended for an
insolent censure on Nero’s life ¹¹3 his Stoic disdain made the disaffected
all over the empire look eagerly to the public journals¹² to mark step by
