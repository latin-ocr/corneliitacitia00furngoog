ll Nero contemplated any general blow at the whole body ⁸, he toolr, as
was usual with him, but one step at a time, and struck down those only
whose position gave importance to their tenets. Even as it was, to force
the senate to condemn such men was beyond anything which he had yet
demanded of it; and there may have been aa much real timidity as
artifice in choosing the moment when public attention was taken off by
the approach os Tiridates ‘, in the rescript pointing to Thrasea without ἵ
