remarkable lact that Corbulo and tbe two brothers Scribonius Rufus and
Proculus (the legati oi the two ‘Germaniae ¹) were all in one year put to
death¹ would show that Nero had conceived suspicion at the same time
ol the commanders ol all his greatest armies; but nothing whatever
remains to indicate its ground. Beyond these names, we have no detail ol
the many cruelties ol Nero in Greece¹; beyond the name ol Sulpicius
Camerinus, none respecting those perpetrated by Helius as his vicegerent
at Rome ³. A lew words ol Suetonius tell us that to the other family
murders were added those ol his adoptive sister Antonia⁴ and his stepson
Rufrius Crispinus⁵; asingle line ol Pliny alludes to the late ol the six
wealtby possessors ol hall the province of Africa⁶ 3 our accounts ol the
reaction under Galba give us names ol several delators whose careers seem
hardly to have begun when the Annals break off. We are told that the
Scribonii lell before the delation ol Paccius Africanus⁷; Licinius Crassus⁸
and Salvidienus Orfitus⁹ and their families belore that ol Aquilius
Regulus ; that Eprius Marcellus had added other noble victims to Thrasea
arrd his friends ¹⁰ ; that iniamy had been incurred on similar grounds by
Vibius Crispus ¹¹, Annius Faustus ¹¹, Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius Attianus,
Cestius Severus ¹⁸ ς and sor exactions or other misdeeds by the freedmen,
as Polyclitus, Vatinius, Patrobius ¹⁴, Petinus ²³, also by Calvia Crispinilla ¹⁰,
and others. When to such indicatione we add the inlerencc derived
from observing how few ol tbe cases mentioned in the extant narrative
ol Tacitus would bave been known to us without it ¹⁷, we can see how
lar we probably are from being able to lorm even an approximate
estimate ol the bloodshed and other acts of tyranny ol the last two years
ol Nero.
Among these latest victims our great interest centres in Corbulo; but
as to any explanation ol his iate we have but conjecture to go upon.
