cm. ut] RULE OF NERO. 87

Supposing it probable that he occupied Armenia, without opposition frorn
the Parthians, till the journey of Tiridates to Rome was accomplished ¹,
his tenure of that country would have reached its natural end when that
prince returned invested by Nero with the diadem3 and, as the ordinary
government of Syria had been for some time in other hands¹, no disgrace
would be implied in his recall to Rome; though the existence of some
suspicion or jealousy may be inserted from Nero's having neither taken
the obvious course of transferring him and his legions to the Jewish war,
nor retained him to direct the expedition (probably already in contempla·
tion) beyond the Caucasus⁸; nor could Corbulo himself have failed to
notice the want of confidence in him implied hythe appointrnent of
Vespasian and Mucianus ⁴. His own offioer‚ Arrius Varus, appears to have
been his chief accuser⁵5 and we are allowed to sce, even from the
accounts of Tacitus, that there were occasions on which ground of accu-
sation may well have existed ⁸. But the suddenness with which Nero
summoned him, and the precautions taken to throw him off his guard ',
seem to point to sorne pressing panic‚ and lend weight to the suggestion
that his name may have been mixed up, without any complicity ou his
own part, in the conspiracy of which his son-inlate Annius Vinicianus is
thought to have been the head ⁸. As to his own unflinching loyalty, re·
pented of only at the last moment of his life, our authority spealrs
unhesitatingly‘.

It is in the narrative of the final catastrophe that we have above all to
deplore our loss of the guidance of Tacitus; by which the many points left
in such great obscurity, respecting the real aim of Vindex, and his relations
with Galba and Verginius, might have been cleared up ¹⁰, and some explana·
tion given oi the causes which had led alilre the Gallie levies and the German
‘and Spanish legions, and governors os such various characters and possibly
discordant motives, to agree at least in treating any continuance of the
Nemnian rule as impossible ¹¹. It is indeed easy to suppose that such
