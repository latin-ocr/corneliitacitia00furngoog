general and standing grounds ol military discontent as were shown in
the mutiny ol so many legions at the death os Augustus against an
emperor oi known vigour and capacity, who had even been their own
victorious general ¹, would have been aggravated at this time by the
news ol the conductos their imperator in Greece and elsewhere, and
by jealousy at the donatives and other gilts lavished on the praetoriana ⁹.
It is again evident that the fate oi Corbulo and the Scribonii must have
taught all provincial commandere what they had to expect, and warned
them that it was saler to take advantage os the discontent oi the troops
than to repressit: and that astate oi things would thus come to exist
which a single spark might set in a blaze. For the further progress
ol the revolt, the weakness, passing at a step from contemptuous indif-
serence to abject paule, with which Nero attempted to sace the situation,
would seem sufficiently to account. '

As regards the last crisis, that ol the defection of the praetoriana, a
lew words ol Tacitus corne in to conlirm the general account. To this
body their long standing allegiance to the Caesars' had not only the
soree of babit, but was also a necessity os their existence: the proclama·
tion ol a Republic would have been their sentence ol disbandment ; nor
had they any desire ol their own sor even achange ol ruler. Fourteen
years os laxity and indulgence had taught them to love a vicious prince
as deeply as their predecessore had ever respecteda strict one⁴; and

the contrast ol Galba could hardly have been more attractive in anticipa·
tion than it proved to be in reality ⁵. But the intrigues oi Nymphidius‘
found their all-powerful support in Nero's own cowardice; and a false
report that the llight which he was known to be contemplating had
already taken place leit them no resource but to make the best ol the
only rival then belore theml, however visionary might be their hope
of the enormous donativo offered in his name ⁸.
