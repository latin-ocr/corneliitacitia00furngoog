can. un] RULE OF NERO. 89

Tacitus has not leit us even a word of allusion to the last scene ; but ’

as the narrative of all historiens could only have rested on the testimony
ol three or four eye-witnesses, it is not likely that the accounts materially
varied. He would no doubt have delighted to contrast the ghastly
irony, which at the last honr deplored the loss to the stage ², and strove
even in its agony to bring out scraps ol literature⁹ and forced efforts
ol expression ⁸, with the serenity and seli-possession which had marked
the last hours ol the tyrant’s most illustrious victims.

An important historical question remains to be considered, how iar
the personal outrages and excesses oi the emperor affected the general
administration of the empire. We have certainly no evidence os excep-
tional misgovemment, such as the universal disturbancc oi settlements
under Gaius, or of such rampant venality and corruption as was preva-
lent under Claudius, nor, until the last year, is there evidence os any
general breakdown of authority. On the other hand, the reputation
gained in the first ‘quinquennium' over-rated, as we have seen reason
to think it has been ⁴, is far from being sustained throughout the later
period; aud we seem to have an impression oi mingled wisdom and
wealrness, as if Nero had been never without good advisers⁸, but
had either listened to them or followed his own impulse as the humour
took him. This may especially be illustrated by the strange interpo-
lation oi the episode os Tigranes in the otherwise consistent polioy
maintained throughout the Eastern war ⁸. The rebellion in Britain was
dealt with in a spirit ol judicious conciliation⁷3 the Jewish war was
taken up on a scale belittiug its seriousness⁸; but in neither case had
any previous account been taken os the widespread and deepseated
causes of discontent which had led to the outbreak. Again, in the
midst os that war, ior which assuredly all the strength available in
the East was needed, we hear of two projectcd expeditioris, that to the
Caucasus, which perhaps ata more opportune time might have been
