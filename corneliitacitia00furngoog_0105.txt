justifiable ¹, and one to Aethiopia ⁸, sor which no intelligible reason has
ever been assigned. In the provincial governorships⁸‚ good appoint-
ments are so far mingled with bad as to preclude either general praise

East, Corbulo by Caesennius Paetus⁷; while Porcius Festus is alone
well spoken of among the later Jewish procurators⁸; and is credit is
given lor selecting such men as Vespasian and Mucianus⁹ to deal nith
the insurrection, it must be remembered that the cruelty os Gessius
Florus had occasioned it, and the incapacity os Cestius Gallus had made

years os Nero ¹¹ would rather, in connection with such appointments,
suggest that redress had become more difficolt, than that governors had
become more pure.

centres ol Italian lile by fresh colonisation¹¹, the extension os Latin
rights to one or more Alpine districts ¹⁸, the incorporation oi Pontus

Polemoniacus in the provincial empire¹‘; and, side by side nith these, -
