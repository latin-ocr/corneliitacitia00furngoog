replace by streets and buildings more worthy of the mistress of the
world the mean and winding thoroughfares of the hasty and frugal
restoration after the Gauiish conquest ², has to be contrasted with the
wholesale appropriation, implied to have been without compensation⁸,
of all the best and most central area of the city by the emperor himself.
It is also to be noticed that the linancial liberality towards the state,
for which he is made to take ostentatious credit⁴, stands in strange
relation to the profligate wastefulness of his general expenditure ⁵, above
all, to the prodigious sum of 2200 milliou H. S. squandered in indis·
criminate largesses⁸, leaving an empty exchequer which the utmost
severity of his successor strove in vain to replenishi.

The fact that no marked changes in the system oi govemment
originated under him, but those already in progress moved with ac-
celerated pace, is due rather to circumstances than to himself. The
profession of respect ior the senate at the beginning oi his rule was
not, and could not well be, accompanied by any real restoration of the
fonctions which Claudius had talten from theml, and was exchanged
for pronounced hatred‘, and the extermination of many of its noblest
families. Some had entered into conspiracy, others had provolred his
animosity by mere pre-eminence or energy ¹⁰, the order as a whole
less creditably by their abject servility, and probably by giving more
and more evidence that their growing incompetence and antiquated

govemment. Hence the threat to carry the Claudian system out to
its completion by abolishing the order altogether, and governing the
