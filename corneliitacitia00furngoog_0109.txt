himself to hold, is shown chiefly in a few points which he alone treats as

made, go for little towards any general reversal 01 judgment 1; 00 10 no

counts in the indictment‚ oue whose victims included every near relation
that he had in the world, and almost every citizen who had given lustre
to the age, would have but little to gain by the verdict. Such names
as those of Britannicus, Agrippina, Octavia, and Antonia, or such as

senate and pcople, who received his most flimsy justifications with
effusive servility ⁴, and welcomed the matricide's return to Rome with
