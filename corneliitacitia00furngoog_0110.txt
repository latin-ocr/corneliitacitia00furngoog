tbe announcement ol murders already perpetrated by decreeing such
public thanksgivings as had been usual aster signal victories ¹. To
complete his demoralisation, such men as Tigellinus accustomed them-
selves to practise lor their own ends upon his tears ², as others had
practised on those ol Claudius ; and the timidity so characteristic ol him
at all stages ol his careers becomes in the last crisis ol his lile a state
ol abject terror, in which he is powerless to act for himself, and is lelt by

. the desertion olbis advisers to his miserable end.

Those in the higher ranks who had thus helped to malre him what

he was hastened to pass sentence ol deposition and death, to wreak their
vengeance on his memory and name, and to make illusory displays ol
freedom⁴; while the numbers who had lived on his bounty to his and
meir disgrace deplored a patron whose like they could never hope again
10111111. Those ol them who believed in the news ol his death, and
continued long to deck his grave with liowers⁶, were important enough
to make Otho and Vitellius seeh their favour by paying respect to his
memory⁷z many on the other hand took advantage ol the mystery
surrounding his end ιο lreep up the beliel tlrat he yet lived and would
return to execute vengeanoe and resume his rule ⁸. The strength ol
such a belief is shown by the support given to pretenders, not only soon
aiter his death 1, but even some twenty years later ¹⁰; and by the long
continued Christian expectation ol the reappearance ol the arch-tyrant
and persecutor as the coming Antichrist ¹¹.
