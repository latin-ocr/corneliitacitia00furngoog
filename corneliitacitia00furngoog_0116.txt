The greatest military achievements could hardly have done more
sor the fame of Augustus than these bloodless victories, elrcd out, as
they evidently were, by no small amount os grandiloquent falsification.
Augustus probably proclairned then, as later ¹, that he could have made
Armenia a province, and merely gave it back as an act oi grace to a
native prince: ‘Armenia Capta,’ or ‘Recepta’ appears on coins¹; and the
achievement there ol Tiberius is ranked with the subjugation by Agrippa
oi Cantabria⁸: the surrender of the standards is no less commemorated
in triumphal medals ⁴, and may well have figured on many an Augustan
work oi art ⁶, as it does on the noblest of this emperor's extant statues ⁶:
poetry ranhs it with the great military glories oi Rome ⁷, pictures the
trophies as 'torn away'⁸ by the victor's hand, the great rivers oi the
East as flowing in humbler stream ⁹, and even Phraates as prostrated
at the linces oi Caesar to do homage for his throne ¹⁰. Ten years ¹¹,
or even thirty years later ¹², the same subject is still an appropriate theme
ior compliment.

Phraates continued outwardly to show ‘all service of reverence ¹³,' and
cemented the alliance some ten years later by sending all his legitimate
family to be domiciled in Rome ¹⁴; a step fruitfiil in consequences by
