supplying ior many a year to corne a stoclr ol Romanised princes ol the
blood to be set up as claimants for the throne. During the latest years
oi Augustus, Roman influence seemed to have reached its highest point,
when the first oi these princes, Vonones, was ionnally summoned and
accepted as the rightful heir, and maintained himself sor some lew years
on the throne oi the Arsacidae ¹.

Nevertheless, the Parthian kings generally made no scruple os inter-
posing from time to time in Armenia² ; in which, lrom the appointment
ol Tigranes 11 in 734, ac. ao, we have ior nearly forty years an almost
continuous history oi interierence and intrigue, resulting in revolution
and mrarchy. The account oi these vicissitudes can be read ai related
in its place by Tacitus ³3 but it will be well to compare here the alterna·
tives open to Rome in dealing with this Alghanistan of the ancient
world.

Subsequent experience may be taken generally to have shown that
a policy oi complete non-interierence would have been best, and that the
efforts oi Rome were lar more needed in extending and consolidating
the empire in other quarters ς but Augustus could not slight the traditions
ol the Republic, or allow it to be said that even an imaginary limit of the
empire had receded under him. Also‚ from the time of the domicile
oi the heirs of Phraates in Rome, the idea oi bringing the Parthian
empire itsell under Roman inlluence through a monarch of the stamp ol
Vonones must have been constantly present; and sor any military
demonstration to support a friendly or threaten a hostile king, the most
practicable route was that which rested on Armenia as a base, and led
' along the Tigris to Ctesiphon ⁴. On the other hand, the transitory
success achieved under Trajan cannot well be regarded even as subse·
quent evidence in favour ol the possibility ol holding this kingdom as
a province ⁶, a course which must certainly have been beyond the pale oi
practical politica when the provincial frontier in Asia Minor had not
extended beyond the Halys ⁶. The only remaining altemative‚ that oi
