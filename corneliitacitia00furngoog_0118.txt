carr. lv.] PARTHIA AND ARMENIA. 103

controllingit asa vassal kingdom, is the one which we have to con·
sider as maintained throughout this period, in various forms from
substantial dependence to mere nominal acknowledgment of suaerainty,
and always under the great difficulty of contending with national afh-
nities and sympathy, balanced no doubt by some dread of Parthian
desponsant

The empty achievement of escorting Tigranes 11 tobis kingdom by
Tiberius Nero was soon nullified hythe Parthian sympathics of his
family: a repetition of the pageant by Gaius Caesar was attended by
resistance which eost his life: the attempt of the Roman party to set up
the rejected Parthian king Vonones was too dangerous for the legatus of
Syria to support3 and at the death of Augustus both Parthia and
Armenia had slipped from his control ¹. ¹

The fortunate coincidence, that a prince acceptable to Rome, and
even in part of Roman lineage, was already the national choice ⁸, enabled
Germanicus in 771, an. 18, to repeat the performance of Tiberius and
Gaius Caesar without any imposing military demonstration⁴ and with
far more effect. Artaxias 111 obtained firm possession of the throne;
and Artabanus, who could not have resisted this combination of circum·
stances, was conciliated by the removal from Syria (which was soon
followed by the death) of Vonones ⁶. This peaceful settlement was so
far successful, that for some sixteen years we hear no more of Eastern
politics; but it is evident that Roman influente in Armenia made no real
progress, and probable on the other hand that the annexation of the
neighbouring kingdoms of Cappadocia and Commagene to the provincial
empire⁶ gave the party of national independence the more ground for ’
thinking that it was from Rome that they had most to fear. lt may well
be that some encouragement from this quarter, as well as his successes
elsewhere and his contempt for the supposed dotage and impotence of
Tiberius, emboldened Artabanus, on the death of Artaxias, probably
about 787, an. 34, at once to seire Armenia for his son, and to address
theold emperor with the most deliant arrogance and insuit ⁷.
