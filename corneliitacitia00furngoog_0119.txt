The narrative of Tacitus¹ gives a full account of the response of
Tiberius to this challenge, and the decisive blows struck by him in
both directions, by instigating the Iberian prince Mithridates to seiae
Armenia ¹, and equipping another and again another of the Romanised
Arsacids, as a leader to the disaflected Parthian nobility ¹. Yet in all
this his habitual caution was not lost sight of. His able lieutenant,
L. Vitellius ⁴, was charged to avoid actual colhsion with the Parthians ¹,
and to give Mithridates no other material help than such as consisted
in distracting the enemy by assuming a threatening position on the
Euphrates ¹. The Armeniam themselves would seem to have remained
passive while their country became a battle-ground between the Parthians
and the chief Caucasiau nations. Scythian tribes hired themselves out
as allies to both, but were in fact present on one side only ¹. The result
showed that the Parthian horsemen were no match outside their own
country for the more mixed iorces¹ and superior hardihood¹ of the
Iberians and Albanians; who were not only able to defeat the young
prince Orodes ¹⁰, but even to gain advantage, by supen'or local knowledge,
over a levy en masse led by Artabanus himself ¹¹. The instability ol
Eastern thrones is illustrated no less strikingly by the revolution which,
following on these disasters, and fomented by Roman intriguc²¹, drove
Artabanus into exile and destitution iu Scythia ¹¹, and made the ad-
vance of his rival Tiridates resemble a triumphal procession ¹¹, than
by the rapid counter-revolutiou which so soon brought th'e old lring
back again, and returned the pretender, as a discrowned fugitive, to
Roman territory¹¹. But in all these vicissitudes Mithridates held his
ground; the powerful Greelr city of Seleucia maintained its revolt¹¹;
and Vitellius was able, just before the death of Tiberius, to compel

Artabanus to male submission and homage, and deliver his son
as a hostage ¹¹. ·

Whatever advantage had been gained was soon scattered to the winds
by Gaius, who, on unknown grounds, summoned Mithridates tobis
presence and imprisoned hirn¹¹‚ set up nothing in place of the govem·
