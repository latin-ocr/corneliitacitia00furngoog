death, the balance turned no less rapidly in the opposite direction;
the civil war between his sons, in which the whole Parthian empire
was involved ³, being taken advantage of by Claudius to reinstate
Mithridates; who, with the renewed support of his brother Pharas-

his own resources. Like him again, he lets slip the precious time ¹⁶,
