106 INTRODUCTION. [cam. w.

tatiously occupying the great historic sites of Ninus and Gaugamela ¹,
soon forced by desertion of allies¹ to face with diminisbed forces a
decisive battle, in which all is lost by the death of his best supporter³‚
then by a further treachery falling into the victor's hands, mutilated,
and contemptuously left to live‘; an ignominious conclusion of the
policy initiated in the later days of Augustus, of controlling the Parthian
empire by means of Romanised Arsacids.

The revolting story⁶ of the murder of the old iring Mithridates, with
his wife and family, at the instigation of his own brother Pharasmanes ⁸,
and by the act of Radamistus, who was at once bis souin-law, brother-
in-law, and nephew⁷, bears chiefly on the present subject as showing
the thorough discredit incurred by Rome through the worthlessness
of its officials on the spot ⁸, and the widespread taint of the ‘avarice ·
of the Claudian timest’ The war of one vassal king upon another
is allowed to proceed without interference: the military commander
of the fortress in which the king and his family had taken refuge is
bribed to urge him, and even to compel him to surrender himself to
his treacherous enemies¹⁰: the court buffoon ¹¹, who bya frealr of fortune
filled the responsible post of procurator of Cappadocia, aiter a futile
show of interference, is induced by another bribe to support by his

sanction and presence the assumption of the crown by the arch-traitorssz
