cm. 1v.] PARTHJA annuntiatus. 107

even the legatus ol Syria thinks, with the majority of his advisers there
present, that all atrocities and quarrels of barbarians were good for
Roman interests, and that a king who owed his throne to a deed of
iniamy would be more manageable than one who had reached it
honourably¹: the legion sent into Armenia to restore order is hastily
withdrawn to avoid collision with the Parthians²2 the garrison which
had betrayed Mithridates appears to have evacuated the country ³.

The Parthian empire was now in the hands of the able and enter-
prising Vologeses ⁴ ; who continued for many years to direct its policy³,
and who now seized the opportunity of fulfilling a standing family
compact⁸ by supporting bis brother Tiridates as the antagonist of the
usurpet, and occupied Armenia and its chief cities without resistancet
' His withdrawal during the winter of 805-806, nn. 52-53 ⁸, gave Rada-
mistus an opportunity of returning; when his vindictive measures⁹,
added tobis previous crimes, roused the spirit of his people; who,
aiter years of tarne submission to one ruler after another ¹⁰, were at
last goaded into insurrection, and drove him from Artaxata in ignomi-
nious flight to his Iberian home¹¹, from whence he appears to have
kept up some desultory warfare till the close of the following year ¹².

We can thus understand the situation when news was brought to
Rome, almost immediately after the accession of Nero, that Radamistus
had finally disappeared, that Armenia was again occupied by Parthian
forces, and that Tiridates was undisputed king¹⁸. The policy initiated
by Augustus had broken down on all points ; the Romanised princes
who had been set up as claimants for the great king's thr0ne had
one aller another failed ignominiously¹⁴; while in Armenia the un-
principled support given to Radamistus had called into existence an
uprousing of national spirit as a new force to be reckoned with, had
enabled the Parthians to pose as liberators of the nation from an odious
tyranny, and had brought back the antipathy to Roman interierence
