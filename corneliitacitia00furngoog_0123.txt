in that country to much the same point at which it had stood after

’ the action of Antonius some uinety years earlier ¹. The accession of

a new emperor undoubtedly gave opportunity for a new departure in
policy; but the necessity of satisfying Roman public opinion and main·
taining Roman prestige on theone hand, and the facts of the situation
on the other, still operated to circumscribe it within narrow limita

The prompt appointment, early in 808, nn· 55, of a general of
the character and antecedents of Corbulo ², satistied public opinion at
Rome that the Parthian defiance was to be met in a corresponding
spirit. Cappadocia, hitherto governed only by a procurator⁸, was to
be his nominal province; and Ummidius Quadratus, who, in spite of
his proved incapacity ⁴, was still left at his post as governor of Syria ⁵,
was required to send to him two of his legions and a corresponding
proportion of auxiliarios, to move his remaining forces to the Euphrates,
and to make preparation for crossing it; while the neighbouring vassal
kings, the Jewish prince Agrippa, Antiochus of Commagene, with
Aristobulus and Sohaemus, newly appointed to rule Armenia Minor
and Sophene, ate directed to assint Corbulo promptly took possession
of his province⁷; and the mere demonstration of Roman force reveals
again, as so often formerly, the internal weakness of the Parthian
monarchy. A rebellion, headed by the king's son and apparently
strong enough to support itself for three years ⁸, starts up; Vologeses
hastily evacuates Armenia, and under further pressure sends hostages
chosen out of the Arsacid nobilityt With this incident, and a petty

quarrel arising out of it between the ill-assorted Roman generals ¹⁰, all
sight of the East for nearly three years is lost to us.

The whole following period is one in which our information is most
unsatisfactory, as compared with what might naturally have been ex·
pected3 for although the Roman general is known to have been the
historiari of his own campaigns, and his work is known to have been
consulted by Tacitus ¹¹, many of the points chiefly interesting to students
of history are left in great obscurity. Regarding itas a military record,
