cm.1v.] PARTHIA AND ARMENIA. 109

we find an absence of sll strategicsl details, and rarely get even clear
indicatione of time or place ¹. In the practice ol grouping the events
of two or more years together, so much is sacrificed to literary effect
aa to leave the time 21 the year, and even the year itself, and the
distinction of one campaign from another, to be made out from some
122162222121122122222222222221122222 and again, the general features
of the physieal geography of the country are wholly ignored ; the situation
of important places is assumed as known or left altogether vague; and
itis only here and there that the mention of some definite locality gives
any indication of the routes taken or positione occupied. Nor are the
defects less serious in the political history. The policy and instmctions
of the Roman govemment, the nature of the negotiatione between the
contending parties, aud the terma proposed or rejected on either side,
are oftener lelt to be gathered than expressly stated.

Fortunat of these defecta, Tacitus must himself be held responsible.
We can hardly suppose that the chronology of the campaigns was thus
confused in the original accouut; and the knowledge of the geography
of Armenia which had grown up in Greece from the time of the Ten
Thousand‚ and in Rome from that of the Mithridatio wars,is stated by
Pliny to have entered upon a new era in his time through the additions
made to it by Corbulo and from other contemporary sources ². It is
likely enough, however, that the tendency to grandiloquence noticed by
Tacitus himself in Corbulo ³, had left ita traces on his work in some
general exaltation of his own personality, which has been exaggerated
22 22 rather than reduced, through the desire of the historian to throw
a strong light upon what he conceived to be a portrait of true Roman
1222212222, 12 contrast 2ο 2122 degradation and effeminacy of Nero ⁴.
Though evidently not altogether blind to the existence of defecta in his
hero³, he has not allowed them 2ο interfere with his idealisation; and
