above the sea, oi Eraeroum and Pasin; irom which descend eastward the
districts os Kars and Erivan3 in the latter os which, on the bank of the
Araxes, and near the northern soot of Great Ararat, lay Artaxata, the
ancient capital. The roads and passes in such a country were lew and
difficult, and most of them during great part oi the year impracticable;

’ the routes most open to an invader from the west being either to cross

the Euphrates near Melitene (Malatia) in Cappadocia, and follow the
course oi either of its branchos, or to take one oi the lines further north,
ansvering to modern caravan roads, from Armenia Minor and Pontus,
or lrom the Black Sea at Trapezus (Trebizond)‚ to the table land os
Erzeroum‚ and thence to strike at Artaxata On the south, the
vulnerable point was the Billis pass, on the vest side of Lake Van,
communicating with the plain oi Mush in the centre ol the country;
whence again the Khynis pass, over the central mountain tanges, east os
the Binghol Dagh, led directly to the plateau of Eraeroum ¹. How lar
south of the Bitlis pass the limits oi Armenia extended is an uncertain
point; still more so the situation of Tigranocerta ², stated to have lain
on the extreme southern frontier oi the kingdom ³, on an elevated site ⁴,
and close to a river known to Tacitus as the Nicephorius ⁵.

As regards the chronology, while it appears clear that the narrative
in Book 15⁶ is that belonging to the years 814·817, au. 61-63, the
apportionment of the narrative in the two previous Books among the
preceding years is matter of great difficulty; and the only winter
mentioned in that period⁷ has been assigned by critics to three
different years.

Is we reckon back from what seems clearly made out, the first question
will be whether the events oi 14. 23-26, related, as they are, wholly
without a break, ate those of the year 813, an. 60, alone, or of the
previous year also: we have again to ask whether the beginning oi this
narrative is to be taken as separated from that ending in 13. 41, 4, by an
intervening unmentioned winter3 whether again the events oi 13. 34-41
are those os one campaign or two, and whether the beginning of actual
hostilities is to be placed in 811, au. 58, or the preceding year.

As regards the first question, Egli’s arguments· seem clearly to show

¹This was tlte route by which the Ten ᾖ15. 1-18; 14-31. Although the
Thoasand had passedthrotrgh the country whole period ol the narrative in this Book
to the sea; and also that by which Lu· seems thus clearly defined, its subdivision
cullushad endeavoured to reaeh Artaxata into separate years lsiull oi difficulty:
