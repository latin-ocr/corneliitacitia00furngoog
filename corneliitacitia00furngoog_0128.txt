was instructed from the first to make overtures, whereby Tiridates was
to be recognised as king, on condition of acknowledging the grant
by doing formal homage to the majesty of Rome ¹. But the Arsacidae
still held their heads too high to do this, and considered that more
than enough concession had been made by the delivery of hostages².
Tiridates had for some time been defucto king, was strong in national
support ³, in constant expectation of effectual help from his brother ⁴,
and probably led by the inaction of the Romans to doubt whether they
meant serious war in any case.

Corbulo was thus forced in 810, an. 57, to begin hostilities in earnest
by leading his now thoroughly disciplined army⁸ into menia, where
its uaining was to be completed by the terrible ordeal of a winter
spent under canvas in probably the most inclement region ever held
as a Roman winter-quarters‘. We are told little, save what tends to
bring out the portrait of the general, his heroic example tobis soldiers ⁷,
his iron discipline in camp and severity to disobedient officere', his
insight into the treacherous designs of Tiridates ⁹, and the like. We

opened in nn. 58 was such asto enable the Romans to draw their
supplies from Trapezus (Trebizond) ¹⁰, and was therefore probably that
of the great table-land of Erzerourn: also that Tiridates, strengthened
by some assistance from his brother ¹¹, pursued a system of predatory
attacks, without allowing himself to be drawn within striking distance,
and of bollow attempts to negotiata ¹² 3 that the Romans were compelled
to adopt similar tacticsss, aided by demonstratione from the Hiberi
