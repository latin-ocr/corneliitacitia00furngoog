114 INTRODUCTION. [cura ru.

by a rapid movement along the Araxes, the complete disappearance of
Tiridates ¹, and the surrender of Artaxata without a battle ¹.

The narrative of the next campaign (14. 23, foll.) is again chiefly
a personal record of Corbulo, of his dealings with the submissim,
the fugitive, the stubbom⁸, his heroic example in the endurance of
drought and heat, as before in that of piercing cold⁴, bis economy of
Roman lives ⁸, his escape from threatened assassination‘. Twice only
are we helped, however slightly, by the occurrence of a definite name
in the vague line of march. From the mention of his ‘passing along
1113 borders of the Mardi⁷,' it is inferred that he had marched from
Artaxata round the foot of Little Ararat to the high plain of Bayazid,
and thence, leaving the basin of the Araxes for that of its tributary
the Balyk, over the watershed of that stream and the Murad at Djadin,
near the foot of the Ala Dagh‚ and thence along the latter river
through the plain of Alashgerd or Arishgerd⁸. The march must
have begun late, as we find the army now exposed to the lierce heat
and drought of the short Armenian summer⁸ (probably about July)
and unable to vary their diet of mere animal food till they reached
a region (perhaps Melazgerd) where the corn was ripe (about August) ¹⁰.
The locality next given (ι Tauraunitium ’) may probably have been the
plain ol Musb ¹¹, where they would leave the Murad and strike south-east
for the Bitlis pass, and thence to Tigranocerta, which could hardly have
been reached before September. ·With its occupation, and the reduction,
after some resistance‚ of Legerda ¹², the campaign may be talxen to bave
closed ¹⁸.

The impression produced by the news of this campaign at Rome
must be gatbered from the fact that a complete change of policy
was its result. Tiridates had wholly disappeared from the scene, his
feeble attempt, in the autumn or following spring, to reenter from
Media, had been so crushed as to leave him without apparent hope
