of resistance¹; and he was now leh out ol account, and the old course,
so often marked by failure, was re-entered, probably early in 813,
nn. 60, by sending out, to be set upon the throne, another Romanised
prince, Tigranes, nephew ol one os the same name who had rnled
ior a short time· in the Roman interest in the last years os Augustus&
The neighbouring princes were bribed, each by a portion os Armenian
territory, to support the new arrangement'; a force os 10001egionary
and 3000 or more auxiliary Roman troops was left in the country;
and Corbulo, after vengeance executed on the disaffected ⁴, withdrew with
his army to Syria ⁵, as ii his work was done.

Yet he must have been well aware that the war, instead of being
over, was only entering on a more serious phase; that to have led
a powerlul army from one end os Armenia to the other‘, in the absence
of the Parthians, was no real conquest, and that the difficulties would
begin again as soon as the backs of the legions were turned; that
the new king could not hold his own for a day without Roman help,
while his mere presence was a standing defiance which the Parthians
could not but take up with energy; the more so as the long drag of
the Hyrcaniae revolt may probably at this time have been opporttmely
removed ⁷, and as Tigranes was himself taking up an openly aggressive
attitude, by invading and endeavouring to annex the Mesopotamiae
district os Adiabene ⁰. It was probably from his foresight that Rome
had now entered upon a path that could only end in failure, that we
find Corbulo now shrinking from the responsibility ol undivided eom-
mand, and desiring to confine himself to a purely delensive attitnde
on the Syrian frontier, and to devolve on another the real conduct
os war in Armenia itsell, with the province ol Cappadocia as its base ⁸.
