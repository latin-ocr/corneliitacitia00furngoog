and dread of Rome ¹, and solemnly in presence of his council investing
Tiridates with the diadem, despatching a force to deal instantly with
Tigranes, and preparing to attack the frontier with all his strength ².
Corbulo immediately met the challenge by despatching two legions
to Armenia ; but the promptness was more apparent than real; for
the commandere are said to have been instructed not to be too ener-
getic⁸, and the legions were not those which he had trained and
led, but the Fourth and Twelfth⁴, which had been left in Syria, and
could have been hardly more fit for active service than his own had
been five years previously.. On the other hand, all possible means
were taken to secure the frontier of ¹Syria on the Euphrates, and even
to threaten an advance from it⁸; and Tigranes, behind the strong
walls of Tigranocerta, well provisioned and garrisoned, mocked the
feeble siege tactics of the Parthians ⁸, whose horsemen were themselves
reduced to straits through the destruction of the herbage by locusts'.
Under these circumstances we are certainly startled to find the Parthians
able, a short time later, to gain in return for their own retirement
from what is represented as a disadvantageous and untenable position,
no less an equivalent than the evacuation of Tigranocerta, the retreat
of the whole Roman army to such winter quarters as it could find

in Cappadocia, the permanent withdrawal of Tigranes, and the oppor-
tunity of sending to make terms at Rome on the basis formerly
proposed ⁸. In the imperfectiori of our record, no trustworthy ex·
