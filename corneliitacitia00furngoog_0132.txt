cras. lta] PARTHIA AND ARMENIA. 117

planation of this turn of events is open to us ; and it is hardly worth
while to speculate whether Corbulo may have foreseen circumstances
likely to make the retention of Tigranocerta during the winter imprae-
ticable, or whether, being avare, as he must have been, that no other
ultimate solution than the recognition of Tiridates was possible, he
desired either to win the credit of accomplishing it before his
successor arrived, or to leave him to face the responsibilities arising
out of its reiection¹.

The spring of 815, ran. 62, brought with it the reiection of the
Parthian embassage², and the arrival of L. Caesennius Paetus in
Cappadocia ³, bringing with him, either as his instructions from Rome,
or as a vaunt on his own part, another change of policy‚ that Armenia
should be freed from puppet kings by becoming a Roman province ⁴.
It might be not much more costly to effect this object than permanently
to keep up Tigranes; but such slight national support as that prince
could command could no longer be counted on, and his threat in
any case was idle, unless an addition of two or three legions to the
normal military establishment was contemplated. Our record of his
first and only affort to re-occupy and hold the country is little more
than an elaborately contrasted portrait of the tvo generals; theone,
cautious and vigilant, strengthening carefully the defences on the
Euphrates, pushing his outposts gradually into the hostile country,
and assuming so formidable an altitude as to make any attack on
his position evidently hopeless⁵5 the other, a braggart in success,
and a eoward in the face of disaster, starting in defiance of what
are made to have been the plain wamings of the gods⁶, with an ex-
travagant design, abandoning it for desultory plundert, and prematurely
(as it would seem ⁸) retiring to the inaction of a winter camp, yet
wording his despatches as if the whole kingdom lay at his feet⁹, and,
