118 INTRODUCTION. [cane. lv.

though quartered in an enemy's country, granting his legions all the
indulgences usual in prolound security and peace¹: again, on the
approach oi the enemy, we have him alternately resting on the advice
oi his subordinate officers and disdaining it², advancing with a show
oi courage and retreating in dismay at the first collision³‚ dispersing
in the supreme crisis a force all too scanty when concentrated, and
placing his best troops in an indefensible position to be overwhelmed

by numbers⁴; then, under the storm ol actual attach, abandoning
all seli-possession, and sending a piteous appeal ior help⁵ to the
colleague whom be bad but lately hardly thought it needlul even to inform
oi the approach of danger ⁸, and finally, blending the strange irony
ol bombastic messagcs to his conqueror⁷ with a capitulation ranking
among the most ignominious in Roman history ³, while the garrison
had still provisions leit and was in less strait than the enemy outside,
and while the expected succour was but three days distant ⁹.

This description, drawn no doubt chiefly from the ungenerous repre·
sentations of Corbulo ¹⁰, cannot now be checked in respect of its particulars
from any other sources ¹¹, but corresponds at least in its general outline
with the broad facts oi what actually took place. In attempting ιο deal
with these we have a total absence os all geography, except the bare
mention oi the Arsanias ¹², Mount Taurus ¹³, and Arsamosata ²⁴, and such
inierences as may be drawn from the statement that Paetus aimed at
recovering Tigranocerta, and at carrying the war into districts which
Corbulo had leit untouched ¹⁶. We should gether that he had crossed the
Euphrates from Cappadocia, probably near Melitene¹⁸, and marched
through the friendly country ol Sophene ¹⁷ ; whence a route led then, as
now, over the Taurus range and by Arsinia to Amida (Diarbeldr), and
