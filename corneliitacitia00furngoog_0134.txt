thence in whichever direction we take Tigranocerta to have lain ¹. We
arc told vaguely of forts taken, booty (chiefly com for winter supply)
collected ¹, and long distances traversedi, without any mention of the
presence of the Parthian force, which must have been mainly confronting
Corbulo ⁴. But the campaign seems to have begun late ¹, and a decision
to have been soon taken to discipline the troops, like those of Corbulo ⁸,
by a winter in the country, and to postpone the attempt to recover
Tigranocerta till the following spring, when another legion, probably of
better quality ⁷, would have joined him. With this resolution taken, he
may be supposed to have retired, on the near approach ⁸, rather than
at the actual arrival of winter, to the camp constmcted probably on the
north bank of the Murad, not iar above its junction with the Kara-
Su¹ 3 and, according to the reckoning here adopted ¹⁰, all the following
events were compressed into the lew weeks still left open for active
operations¹¹.

Many of the raees composing the Parthian empire, and especially
those inhabiting the plain of Iran and the adjoining mountain tracta,
were better able than Greeks or Romans to endnre the severities of
winter¹²; and once at least before in the history of the Arsacidae, a
decisive victory had been snatched by them in this season¹¹. On this
occasion, the insonnation that Paetus had dismissed all thought of being
attached and was giving hrrloughs to all who had asked for them ¹⁴, that
even the two attenuated legions were not together ¹¹, and that the camp
was ill-provisioned¹⁶‚ must have inspired Vologeses with the idea of
suddenly launching on Armenia the force which then faced Corbulo at
Zeugma ¹⁷, when any regular siege was precluded by the season, and when
