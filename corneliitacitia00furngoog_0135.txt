the only chance was that of acoup de marii, which in any ordinary case
must have proved a failnre, and which only a series of unforeseen
blunders crowned with complete success.

The Twelfth legion was brought up to the Roman head-quarters; and
the whole army, with its weakness revealed by concentration¹‚ was
advanced on a reconnaissance in force’ beyond the Taurus pass¹ ; whence
on the first collisiou both sides seem to have receded, the Romans
retreating hastily to their camp, the Parthian advance probably falling
bach on their main body ⁴‚a movement so misinterpreted by Paetus as to
lead him to think that an isolated force of 3000 legionarias ou the height,
supported by a body of cavalry on the plain, would suffice to arrest his
enemy's progress. By their speedy annihilation or dispersim, Paetus
was left, deprived of his best horsemen¹ and of probably near half his
legionaries ¹, to hold out with the temnant (now still further weahened
by the detachment of a cohort to Arsamosata τ) till the succour, at last
urgently implored⁸, should arrive with Corbulo. That the case was still
not desperate is evidenced by the fact that provisions still remained, and
that the Parthians, though time was all-important, made no attempt to
storm the camp ⁸: nor, to do Paetus justice, is he represented by Tacitus
as himself inclined to iiinch from his undertaking ¹⁰, hut as forced to
make terms by the utter demoralisation of his troops ιι; which, partly no
doubt, due to their original unfitness for service, had been aggravated
by constantly increasing proof of their leader's incapacity, and finally
brought to a head when the wounded survivors of the carnage on the
mountain returned to increase the consternation and dismay ¹¹.
