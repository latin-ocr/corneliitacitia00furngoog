camp and its stores were to be surrendered, and the river bridged to
enable the victors to carry off their booty¹; and the evacuation itself,
with the insults attending it ², broke down the last remains os disci·
pline‚ arrd turned the retreat into a headlong flight, in which lorty miles
were covered in one day and the wounded abandoned all along the
route³3 until, probably somewhere near Melitene, this wreck ol what
had been a Roman army encountered the troops advancing to their
rescue‘.

Tacitus, if he has not directly charged any ol the blame lor this
catastrophe on Corbulo¹ has certainly done so by implication‚ in attributing
his inaction under the first message from Paetus to his desire to win
the glory ol appearing as a deliverer in the last extremity⁸. What
explanation he may himself have given can be only guessed at; but it
may probably have been that the first message was in no way urgent‘3
that a sorce supposed by him to consist os two unbroken legions in
strong winter quarters should have been able to take care of itself ; that
in getting ready a force lor instant action ⁷, despatching it on the first
really urgent message, and hastening by forced marches to the spot ⁸,
he had done all that could reasonably have been expected. Yet it cannot
be denied that his whole attitude during the campaign had been that
oi one who desired not to aid but to increase his colleague's difficulties
He had sent to him sor the most important service the least efficient
legions ⁹: his own elaborate preparations, and the forts constmcted along
the Euphrates, which betokened‚ if anything‚ preparations ior an offensive
movement‚ had only served to convince Vologeses that nothing ol the
kind was intended by them ¹⁰, and that he might safely withdraw his army
from their neighbourhood; nor had the obvious course been taken of
turning these advanced posts to account in support os such a demonstra·
tion in soree beyond the river as might have recalled the invaders ol
Armenia to protect their threatened communicatione. His rejection ol
the proposal oi Paetus, to lead at once the whole force back into
Armenia ¹¹ (from which Vologeses, apparently in great strait sor sorage ¹⁹,
had at once retreated)‚ is intelligible enough. The season was too late to

Rome. Analleged condition is disputed ³15· 10, 7. Unless the suggested
