take up new winter quarters in that country; his own force was not on a
large scale¹; and the rabble oi Paetus would not be an aid but an
incumbrance: still it is difficult to suppose that his instructions from
home tied him as strictly as he implied, or that his position'in Syria,
held by three nearly complete and thoroughly efficient legions, was as
much imperilled as he affected to apprehend ².

The year closes with the retirement os Paetus to winter in Cappadocia³,
and with an interchange ol messages between Vologeses and Corbulo,
whereby the latter consented to destroy his outposts beyond the Euphrates,
on condition oi the withdrawal ol all the Parthian garrisons lest behind
in various lortified places in Armenia ⁴. Thus all preparation ior offen·
sive movement was abandoned on both sides, and affairs seemed to have
dristed back onoe more into the position in which the arrival oi Paetus
had found thern ⁵ ; but with the difference that Tiridates, the only prince
who could hold his own in Amenia by national support without ex·
ternal iorce, was more than ever master os the situation, and that

the prestige oi victory had shilted altogether from the Roman to the
Parthian side.

The embassy which Vologeses had been '‘ permitted to send ⁸,’ reached
Rome early in 816, nn. 63⁷, and exposed the hollowness oi the gas·

conading despatches oi Paetus ⁸. The Parthian king spolie with just
pride oi his success and clemency, and wrote as one who had to offer
terms instead oi petitioning. The actual sovereignty oi Armenia was
treated as no longer in question; but Tiridates would consent todo
homage lor it in presence os the symbols oi the empire at the camp oi
Corbulo, and would even have offered to come to Rome for investitura,
ii it were not ior a religious difficulty ⁹. The council ol Nero ¹⁰, driven to
find some means oi reconciling the facts ol the situation with the satis·
saction of imperial honour, fastened on the last point as one on which
compliance might be extorted, so that they should not seem to have
accepted tenus from the victor. Outwardly indeed, the Parthian pro·
posals were rejected in a spirit ol defiance; but the possibility ol such a
compromise was understood to be implied in the conciliatory gilts
