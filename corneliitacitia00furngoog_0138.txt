presented to the embassy ¹, and was no doubt distinctly intimated in the
new instructions to Corbulo; who (on the recall of Paetus²) was now
reappointed to the undivided command ³, with such extended powers as
would appear to imply the possession of a general ‘imperium procon-
sulare ⁴' in the East His preparations, in accordance with the outward
show of uncompromising hostility, were on such a scale as to betoken an
intention of complete reconquest. The two broken and demoralised
legions which had capitulated were sent back to Syria and replaced by
the two famous legions of his former campaigns, to which were added
that which should have j0ined Paetus from Moesia, and another now
sent to him from Pannonia; the force being made up by its auxiliaries
and the contingente of neighbouring prinoes to a strength of prob·
ably from 4o,ooo to 5o,ooo men ⁶, and forming by far the strongest
army in numbers and quality which had ever been despatched against
Annenia.

We have again, as in former years, the same personal exaltation of
Corbulo. The powers conferred on him are likened to those given in
old time to Pompeius⁶ ; he is made to open out afresh the disused route
of Lucullus ⁷, as if to recall the memory of that famous campaign in
which a force, barely amounting to one third of that now following him,
bad humbled the pride of the first Tigranes ⁸. Vologeses, who had
offered conditions at Rome as avictor, sends to him as a petitiones and
obtains from him an armistice⁸; the respect in which his name is
held ¹⁰ is such as to make Tiridates accept without hesitation at his advice
the terms of submission which had been treated as impossible in the
embassy to Ner0¹¹3 after an exchange of courteous interviews, it is in
bis presence that the dishonour associated with Rhandeia is obliterated
on the same spot ¹² by the deposition before the eagles and the emperor’s
effigy of the diadem which Tiridates bound himself no more to wear till
he should have received it again at Rome from the hand of Nero ¹³; and
itis with his dignified hospitality that the scene is closed ²⁴.

As regards any military operatione, our information is again vague
