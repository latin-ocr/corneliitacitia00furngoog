would point to an advance upon Tigranocerta; but there is no record
that he ever reached or approached it ¹, and we next hear 31 him as lar

record 31 this great army than aa striking terror by expelling the
principal supporters 31 Tiridates, destroying their strongholds, and other
acts ol desultory warlare, not greatly exceeding those recorded 31 Paetusl.
For this startling contrast between the magnificent array 3113333 and
the results achieved by it, it would be unjust to blame the general, who
was no doubt hampered by the instructions 31 his government, which had
to extricate itsell from the difficulty oi seeming to accept terms which lt
had before rejected by insisting thus absolutely upon investitura at Rome.
Probably by no other means but by the display 31 irresistible lorce on
the spot, coupled with the conciliatory messages 31 Corbulo, could the
Parthians be made to see that this one point 31 lorrn alone kept them
spart ³, but that, sooner than give up this, Rome was prepared to employ
all the strength 31 the empire. This point once clearly seen, arr under·
standing must have been soon arrived at. Not indeed that Tiridates
conceded nothing, or would without considerable pressure have accepted
a condition which, besides carrying with it 3 religious difficulty ⁴, involved
the undertaking ol a journey ol vast length, at the slow pace necessitated
by the pomp and state suitable to eastern royalty⁸‚ the liability at every
stage to what he might consider slights or insulta at the hands 31 Roman
officials ⁸, and, above all, a public scene ol submission before the eyes 31
assembled Rome⁷3 all ol them condescensions to which 3 king and the
brother 31 the Great King could not but be deeply sensitive, however he
might seel that the substantial spoils 31 war were aller all his, aud
however truly any such stately sentence as that with with Tacitus
concludes this narrative might more fitly have become the Parthian than
the Roman mottol.
