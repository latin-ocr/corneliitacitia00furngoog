erre. 1111 PARTHIA AND ARMENIA. 125

To recapitulate the phases through which the Armenian question had
in these years passed :—at the outset, the offerto recognise Tiridates,
on condition 01 his aclcnowledging the kingdom as the giit 01 Rome,
had been made by the Roman govemment and rejected by the Parthians¹:
at a second stage, when Artaxata lay in ashes, Tigranocerta was
occupied by Roman troops, and Tiridates was a fugitive in Media, the
offer had beeu cancelled, and Tigranes set on the throne¹ ; and aller his
withdrawal there had been at least some professed intention 01 reducing
the kingdom to a province³z at a third stage, the Parthians had so iar
learnt prudeuce as, even in their hour 01 victory, to oller in some shape
the homage which they had at first disdained⁴r in the last, the condition
of the personal presence 01 Tiridates in Rome is insisted on ratberto
save Roman honour than as important in itsels; a lame and impoteut
conclusion to so severe a struggle, yet preferable to the only possible
altemative, that 01 the tenure 01 Armenia as a province and the permanent
increase 01 the military establishment by the force required to hold it ⁵.

Tiridates, returned to Armenia in 819, nn. 66, as its acknowledged
king‘; and the settiemeut had at least the merit of permanence. The
only expedition subsequently projected by Nero in the East was in the
Parthian no less than in the Roman interest⁷t the memory 01 Nero was
held in lu'endly recollection throughout those regions even alter his
