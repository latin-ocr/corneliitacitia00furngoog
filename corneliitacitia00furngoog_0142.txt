cm. v.] CONQUEST OF BRITAIN. 127

more properly to an edition of the Agricola. lt is sufficient here to note
that his general knowledge on these points is hardly so much in advance
of that of Caesar and Strabo as we should have expected from his date
and his exceptional means ol information.

In the Agricola he correctly characterises the results of the invasione
of Julius Caesar ¹, and refers the long subsequent inaction to the civil
wars, the ‘politic forgetiulness' oi Augustus, and the powerful influence
oi his ideas on the mind of his successor¹; an explanation which he
would probably have set forth with more detail in the body of his larger
worlr.

It must be plain that Caesar's professed obJect in invading Britain⁸
could have been only very imperfectly and temporarily attained by the
successes gained in it; and that, il he really believed the independence oi
the island to be a standing menace to the peace ol Gaul, he must have
contemplated some permanent occupation of it; and that this scheme,
though thrown into the baclrground by the great expedition to the East,
on which his energies were concentrated at the time oi his death, was
among the ideas bequeathed by him to bis successors. He had shown that
to land an army in the country and to penetrate its lorests was practic-
able, and that the means of dividing its people by intrigue were ready to
hand; that there would be tribes, such as were in his time the Trino-
uantes oi Essex⁴, as ready to invite Roman interference as had been the
Aedui and Remi of Gaul.

By the partition of the empire under the triumvirate, the execution ol
the dictator’s ideas in respect of the occupatlon of Britain would sall to
the share oi his nephew, who was apparently so lar penetrated with the
necessity ol sustaining his reputation by an advance in that direction as
to have at least made some show of preparing to invade this country as
early as 720, a. c. 34, when he was recalled from Gaul by the Dalmatian
rising ⁸.

The idea os this conquest, though again postponed by the imminent
civil war⁸,is lrept prominently belore the public mind in the literature
of the years immediately before and after Actium⁷3 and the announce-
