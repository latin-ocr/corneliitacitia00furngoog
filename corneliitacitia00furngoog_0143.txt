ment of an expedition for this purpose under the persoual command of
Augustus must have roused expectation to its height in 727, rac. ay ¹.
This intention again is stated to have been frustrated in the following
year by the rising of the Salassi and the obstinate resistance of the
Cantabrians’ ; and some doubt may be allowed whether a conquest of
Britain, any more than of Parthia³, was ever seriously entertained, in
the light of his reduction oi the vast army that had corne under his
command at the close of the civil war to a standing peace establishment
of only eigbteen legions ⁴. It is at any rate certain that from the year
above mentioned the idea of a British expedition fades out of sight ⁵, and
that, at some time afterwards, some similar combination oi policy and good
fortune to that which brought about a peaceful solution of theParthian
question· enabled Augustus to save his credit, and to represent his object
as substantially gained, without loss of blood or treasure. Two British
princes are recorded to have fied from their land to his protection⁷3 and
the prominence given to this event in the ‘Monumentum Ancyranum'
allows us to suppose that it was duly represented at the time in some light
favourable to Roman dignity⁸; while some more unmistakeable acts of
homage are instanoed by Strabo ⁹, who describes the island generally as
