resented as a grievance, and that some note of defiance was blown
across the Channel ¹, which may have had its share, with the remems
branae ol former tellure, in irritating the Roman pride. Also, in such a
ruler as Claudius, personal vanity, and the desire to out-do his pre·
decessore, must count for something. Suetonius, as might be expected,
thinks his desire to win the full honours oi a triumph a sufficient expla-
nation ol the whole undertaking²; and the monotony with which the
rhetorical boast, that he had been first to extend the empire beyond the
Ocean, is paraded in his own speech ³, in the triumphal inscription ⁴,
aud in contemporary epigrama ⁸, shows the light in which he wished the
achievement to be regarded. Lastly, the prominence ol Narcissus in the
narrative oi the despatch of the expedition⁶ suggests the cupidity oi
freedmen and other courtiers as another great prompting motivel, and
that the increased trade may have led the Romans to exaggerate the
mineral and other wealth ol Britain no less than they had before de·
preciated it ⁸.

The circumstances of the time were iavourable to a new extension oi
the empire, in so iar as the general tranquillity on the northern and
north-eastem frontier allowed the garrisons there stationed to be re·
dueed below the strength which Augustus (in his later years) and
Tiberius had considered necessary ⁹. lt is, however, to the creditos
those who organised this expedition, that they foresaw that it could not
be undertahen without some augmentation of the standing army ¹⁰, and
