that they planned it on no such paltry scale as that estimated under
Augustus ¹, buton one really commensurate with the magnitude and
difficulty oi the enterprise, and more nearly following the actual ex·
perience iumished by the second expedition oi Julius Caesar ².

Four complete legions ¹, all well known subsequently in British war-
lare, were draited ior the service, the ‘Secunda Augusta' and ‘Quarta-
decima Gemina Martia' irorn Upper Germany, the ‘Vicesima Valeria
Victrir' irorn Lower Germany, and the ‘Nona Hispana’ from Pannonia ;
' which province also iurnished a ‘vexillatio' or detachment, probably
from 500 to 1000 strong, from another oi its legione, the ‘Octava
Augustat’ This would give a strength os irom 20,000 to 25,0oo
legionaries as the nucleus os the army, to which must be added more
than as much again, lor the ‘alae' and ‘cohortes' ol auxiliary or non·
citizen troops ⁵, making the whole army probably nearly 60,000⁸.

The great flotilla collected to transport these troops and to protect
their landing was no doubt the commencement of the ‘classis Britannica 3’
which plays a conspicuous part in the campaigns of Agricola ⁷, and
which appears afterwards to have had its principal station at Lymne
(‘ portus Lemanis ') ⁸.
