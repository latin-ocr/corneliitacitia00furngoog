in the selection of its officers. It is doubtless due to the imperfectiori of
our history of this period that so little ia known of the previous life of
Aulus Plautius Silvanus, the commender-inchief, who can hardly be
supposed to have owed his advancement in any degree to his relationship
to one of the emperor's wives ¹. He is called by Dio ‘a senator of the
highest repumtion²,' is lmovvn to have been consul some fourteen years
previously, and at some time legatus of Delmatia ³, aad must have been
at this time in command of some important province connected with the
expedition ⁴. His capacity may be taken as established by his achieve·
ments 3 and he was supported by subordinatas, to command whom must
have been in itself no mean honour. Foremost among them stands the
great name oi Vespasiae, who was then legatus of the Second Legion
after his praetorship⁶‚ and whose distinction in this war was afterwards
regarded as his first ‘designation by iate· for future eminence'. In some
command under him was his elder brother Flavius Sabinus⁷, better
known as the city praefect of the great year of civil war⁸¹ Apparently
in command of another legion was Cn. Hosidius Geta ⁹, already lcnown
as having sueceeded to, and carried out to its completion, the daring
strategy of Suetonius Paulinus in Mauretania¹⁰, and afterwards credited
in this campaign with having once at least snatched a victory out of a
defeat¹¹. The names of the other ‘legati legionum' are unfortunately
lost to us; but we find a still more distinguished staff following in the
personal train of Claudius. First among these is another tried soldier
and future emperor, Servius Sulpicius Galba ¹¹, another a consular of long
standing, M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, who had already won triumphal
honours for some previous exploit¹³. Among others of the same high
