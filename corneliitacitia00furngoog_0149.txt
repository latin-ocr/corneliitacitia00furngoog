received a severe checlr‚ and the Britons, though Togodumnus had now
perished, appeared in no way dispirited ; whereupon Plautius, in accord·
ance with previous instructions, halted the whole army on the bank of
the Thames‚ and sent for further reinforcements¹ and for the presence
of the emperor himself.

In this narrative, the most definite detail is the mention of the Boduni,
and it is a great question whether it is not also the most misleading.
The name, which is otherwise unknown, has been naturally taken to be
an error of transposition for that of the Dobuni, who in the time of
Ptolemy had Corinium for their town ², and must have occupied a district
coinciding mainly with Gloucestershire. This, added to the statement
of Dio that the expedition sailed westward, led most modern critica to
put the landing-places considerably further west than would otherwise
be supposed ³, and to take the river at which the chief resistance was
encountered to be as tar distant from the place of landing as the
Gloucestershire Avoo, or some other stream in that part of the country ⁴.
But on this supposition, the retreat of the Britons from any such point
to the south side of the estuary of the Thnmes seems wholly inexplic-
able ⁸. lf, on the other hand, we conclude, with Mommsen⁶ and others,
