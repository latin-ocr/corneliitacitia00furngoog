cnm. V.] CONQUEST OF BRITAIN. 137

The record of the movements of Claudius, which may probably have
been taken from the ‘acta publica,’ represents him as having been only
sixteen days in Britain ¹, a space barely sufficient for what Dio tells us
of his doings: that he found the army on the Thames, immediately
crossed with it, fought and won another battle, pushed on to and occu·
pied Camulodunum, and received the submission of those princes who
surrendered on the spot, and, after repeatedly accepting the title of
‘imperator ²,' set out for Rome, sending on Pompeius and Silanus, his
sons-in-law, to announce his victory. On his arrival he celebrated a
magnificent triumph, followed by games and other spectacles ou a grand
scale, and distributed with a lavish hand distinctions and decoratione
among his followers⁸.

Itis of more importance to endeavour to trace the progress of con·
quest, during the three remaining years of the command of Plautius;
but of these no further record is left to us than a short summary of the
achievements of Vespasian: that he ‘fought thirty battles, subdued two
powerful nations, took more than twenty towns, and reduced the island
of Vectis (Wight)¹.' The scene of these expioits has been generally
placed in the south-vestem part of Britain, part of which must cer·
tainly have been reduced to submission at a very early date, as the pigs
of lead from the Mendip district are found to bear the names of the
emperor and his son as early as 802, nn. 49 ⁶. lt issnggested theta
