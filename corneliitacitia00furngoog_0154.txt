cmv] CONQUEST OF BRITA IN. 139

tion oi conquest was the honour oi an ovation ¹, otherwise as jealously
reserved for the imperial family as the greater triumph itsell ¹.

With the appointment ol his successor P. Ostorius Scapula, in 800,
ao. 47, we recover the guidance of Tacitus3 but it cannot be said that
we gain from him any clear conception oi the military movements. We
bave rhetorical descriptions oi battles and vague geography, reminding
us oi that oi the campaigns of Germanicus: nor have we even, as we have
usually in the Annals, the means oi distinguishing the campaigns of
successive years ⁸.

We are told that the new legatus, on his arrival late in the season ⁴,
had at once to deal with aggressions oi the unsubdued tribes without and
the first recorded insurrection within the subjected territory; the latter
movement being headed by the Iceni, who had already fallen under
suspicion, and rose in indignation against the precautionary rneasuresfl
enforced upon them. The rising, which can hardly have been very
widespread or formidable, was crushed by the auxiliary troops without
the aid of the legions⁸3 and the lceni, though still leit under the rule oi
a native prince⁷, had probably from this time an approach to the
undisguised and oppressiva subjection which some thirteen years later
drove them to despair.

We may probably place in the spring oi θοι, an. 48, the raid made
on some portion oi Cheshire or Flintshire⁸‚ and the contemplated pro·
gress in that direction, checked by the threatening attitude ol the hitherto
friendly Brigantes oi Yorkshire and other adjacent counties⁹. For the
remaining three years or more oi his rule and liietirue, Ostorius is
engaged in the struggle, destined to last till the time oi the Flavian
emperors ¹⁰, against the desperate resistance oi North and South Wales.
At the opening oi our narrative these are united under the heroic leader-
ship of Caratacus, who, aiter the wreclr oi his inherited dominion in the
East ¹¹, bad thrown himself into this stronghold of national independence,
