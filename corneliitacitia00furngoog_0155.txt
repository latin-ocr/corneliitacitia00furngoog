and won confidence by many successful and drawn battles fought under
his command ¹. A single sentence, describing the diversion of the first
attaclt on the Silures by a skillul laterai movement along the valleys,
making North Wales and the adjacent enunties tbe immediate seat of
wm', seems to be all our record of some three years of conflict, traces
of which may probably be found in the British entrenchments on the
Wrelrin and on several other hilis, in some of whose names that of the
chieftain seems to be preserved, in Shropshire and Herefordshire⁸ ; one
of which (Caer·Caradoc, near Church Stretton) confronted at a distance
. of some ten miles the Roman position of Viroconium⁴ (Wroxeter);
which we may suppose to have become at this time the headquarters
of the attacking force, and probably the permanent station of the
Fourteenth legion ⁶. Nor is anything told us of the circumstances which
led or forced Caratacus, probably in the course of 804, an. 51, to stalre
his fortunes on a pitched battle, the description of which⁸ resembles that
of many another conflict with Germans or other enemies of similar
quality. The enemy, wrought up to the highest pitch of contage by the
leader’s example and exhortation, occupies a carefnlly chosen position,
strong by nature, and additionally strengthened by stone walls, which are
carried by the Roman ‘testudo’3 a second position further np the
heights is stormed with eqnal success; the close attaclr of the legions,
added to the storm of missiles hurled by the light troops on the bare
heads and unprotected bodies of their adversaries, completing the victory
and carnage. The immediate capture of the wile and daughter, and
surrender of the brothers of Caratacus ⁷, is followed soon by bis own
deliverance into captivity‚ and from the time of the transportation of these
illustrious prisoners to Rome⁸ the great house of Cunobelinus is lost sight
of in British history ⁹.
