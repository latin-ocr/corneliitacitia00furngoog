erant] CONQUEST OF BRITAIN. 141

Otherwise, the catastrophe appears to have made little differenes
except that no more pitched battles are risked, and that the tactics
previously successful are steadily adhered to. Almost immediately aiter
the sall of Caratacus, it is found necessary to fix the permanent head-
quarters ol the Second legion at Isca Silurum¹ (Caerleon on Usk); and
the position is with the greatest difficulty established At one dme the
iorce on the spot is barely rescued srorn utter destruction by the timely
support oi the main army¹3 at another, the loraging parties are cut off³3
at another, the whole legion sustains a reverse, and the Silures, rendered

only more desperate by threats of extermination¹, are again masters oi
the country and draw other tribes to join them⁵. From this time too
the hostility ol the poweriul Brigantes in the North has to be rechoned
with ; and Venutius, one oi their princes, comes to the front as the most
skilhrl national leader ⁸.

Early in these renevred troubles Ostorius died at his post, worn out by
continual variare ⁷3 and during the five years of Didius Gallus⁸ and the

one year os Veranius' (805-811, Α. n. 52-58) no advance ol' dominion is
noted ; though it is probable that in this period ol seeming inaction the
. chains of conquest were being lirrnly riveted upon the land within and
slightly beyond the space already subjected ¹⁰; that Isca and probably its
subordinate post Venta (Caerwent) are strongly held against the Silures,
Viroconium against the Ordovices; while Deve (Chester) and Lindum
(Lincoln) form also outposts confronting the Brigantes; each oi these
tour positions becoming the headquarters os a legion; and all being
connected with each other and with their bases ol support in the south·
east oi the province by the long lines of the Foss Way and the Watling
Street, and their subsidiary branchos ¹¹.
