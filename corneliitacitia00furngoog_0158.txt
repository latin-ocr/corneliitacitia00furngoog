0111. v.] CONQUEST OF BRJTAIN. ¹43

It is probable that the successes which marked the first two years’ rule
01 the distinguished soldier, C. Suetonius Paulinus¹ (810, 813, 1. o.
59, 60), were gained 10 1110 region 01 North Wales, as we find him
emboldened by them in the following year.(814, 1. 0. 61), aster carelul
preparation 01 means 01 transport to oarry the Roman arms into its
lurthest recess, and hythe occupatiori 01 Μο00 (Auglesey) at once to
deprive the rebels 01 their salest refuge¹, and to extirpate British Druidism
in its innermost sanctuary. Ewen veteran soldiers recoiled at first in
panic from the sacred soil; the shores 01 which, besides bristling with
anned defenders, were lined with the holy men uplilting their hands to
heaven in solemn imprecation, and with dark robed torm-bearing
women, reminding themoi the furies ol tragic legend. Notwithstanding
these terrors, the landing was soon loroed, and the lirebrands 01 the
enemy turned to their own destruction ς the massacre had taken its
course, the altars 01 human sacrifice had been destroyed, the sacred
groves had laben before the axe ³, when Suetonius was hastily recalled
to 1000 tbe gravest crisis that had ever threatened Roman rule in Britain.

The great rising ol the Britons 01 the eastern districts⁴is not only
lully described in the Annals⁵, but also occupies what is a considerable
proportionate space in the Agricola ⁸, and still more so in the abridge·
1000101 Dio ⁷. Both authors have duly chronicled the portents by which
the disaster was said to bave been heralded ⁸ ; and to Dio we owe lurther
a description 01 the personal appearance 01 1110 heroine queem her
commanding stature, stern countenance, flashing eyes, masculine voice,
her abundanee 01 0011010 11011 lloating down to her hips, her golden tore,
embroidered tunic, and thick cloak clasped over it, as she stands, spear in
hand, to address ber countrymen ⁹.

The causes 01 1110 rising, as given by Tacitus earlier in the Agricola ¹⁰,
amount to no more than the general grieranees 01 0 proud and 1100
