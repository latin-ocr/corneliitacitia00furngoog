people, gevemed as provincial subjecta were still too often govemed.
In the Annals¹ the wrongs of at least the lceni and Trinouantes are
definitely specilied ; we have the personal outrage inflicted on Boudicca
and her daughters, the extortionate spirit in which the Romans exacted
the inheritance left to them by the old king Prasutagus, the spoliation
aud even enslavement of the Icenian nobles; while the Trinovantes
had been goaded to despair by the violence ol the veteran colonists ol
Camulodunum, by the consecration of their slavery in the erection ol a
temple there to Claudius, and by the exactione ol the priests at that alien
sanctuary. Dio tells us’ that the procurator was treating as revocable,
and actually reclaiming, the former bounty ol Claudius to friendly chief-
tains, and adds that at the same time Seneca was rigorously exacting
lrorn the overburdened people the repayment ol a loan ol torty
million Hs, which he had induced them against their own will to
contract

The fatal confidence which had banished all the legions to a distance
and left the heart oi the province unguarded ⁸, was now signally chastised.
The leeble garrlson of Camulodunum, with the trilling reinlorcement
thrown into it by the procurator, was speedily overpowered, its only
stronghold, the temple precinct, was nermedis garrison massacred,
and the obnoxious procurator only saved by ssight to Gaul. Α still
graver disaster followed: the Ninth legion, hurrying rapidly to the
rescue, probably lrom Lindum ⁴, under Petillius Cerialis, was cut to
pieces, and only the legatus and the cavalry escaped ⁸.

In endeavouring to retrieve the terrible consequences ol his own
negligence, Suetonius had probably as arduous a taslr before him as had
ever fallen to the lot of a Roman general. We may suppose that the
Fourteenth legion had accompanied him to Mona, with perhaps part ol
the Twentieth,·that the remainder ol that legion was at Deva, the Second
