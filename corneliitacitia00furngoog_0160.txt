be withdrawn without leaving Deva at the mercy ol the Brigantes; the
Ninth had already marched on and met its late. So that the Fourteenth
and part of the Twentieth legion, with auxiliaries making up the total to
about ro,ooo men, were the sole soree with which he had to iace the
enemy and reconquer the province. He reached Londinium¹ without
molestation, but was compelled to leave both that town and Verulamium
to their late, and was unable to prevent a massacre ol Roman citizens,
traders and others friendly to them, such as had not been seen since the
days oi Mithridates. From seventy to eighty thousand are computed to
have perished; and it must have been somewhere in the midst oi this
horror and carnage that he was compelled by wantos provisions⁸ to
stalre the whole issue on a battle against overwhelming numbers, flushed
with previous victory and animated to a crowning etiort. It was perhaps
never known in Rome how near the tragedy oi the Teutoburgiensis
Saltus had been to repeating itself. But Paulinus, whatever his errore,
was no Quintilius Varus, nor were the British ranks commanded by an
Arminius. Though compelled to fight, he was allowed by some strange

to await the decisive moment when the Britons began to waver under the
