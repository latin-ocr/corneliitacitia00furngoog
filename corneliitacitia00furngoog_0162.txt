cm».v.] CONQUEST OF BRITAIN. 147

perfectly subdned nations to the west, while the latter place and Lindum
were still the Roman outposts to the north, much was no doubt done to
reestablish order, and bring back commerce to its accustomed channels.
No subsequent outbreak within the conquered district is ever recorded;
and we may assume that the towns which had been wrecked soon rose
from their ruins, and that the fatal negligence which bad left thern un-
protected was not repeated. Camulodunum, in particular, may probably
have owed to this restoration the still remaining walls ¹, a mile and three
quarters in circuit, enclosing an oblong camp-like area of 108 acres‚a
space which, if forming the limit of the colonia at this date, is far short
of that covered by urban and suburban habitations in subsequent days
of peace.

The walls of Verulamium appear to be of similar strength to those at
Colehester, but are those of a town rather than of a military position,
enclosing an area of nearly double the extent, and taking a circuit
bearing so considerable a resemblance to the sire and shape of Pompeii²
as to have suggested the possibility of intentional imitation; a sup-
position which, should it be confirmed by further investigation, would
tend to show that the town had been thns laid out before Pompeii was
destroyed, and therefore (as is otherwise probable enough) at a date soon
after its ruin in the insurrection.

The defence of Londinium appears to have been less completely pro-
vided for; as the only Roman walls now traceable round the city or
recorded by any evidence are referred to a much later date⁸5 bnt the
