most essential point, the command oi the passage over tlre Thames, was
probably from this time secured by a permanent bridge, the approach to
which was guarded by a strong ‘castellum'¹; within which met two
great mods, the Ermine Street leading to Camulodunum and the north,
arrd the Watling Street, diverted from its older and unprotected course¹
to one thus placed thoroughly under command. It is probable also that
the approach to the bridge on the southern side was similarly protected ⁸.

We may further assume that most, il not all, os the statione already
mentioned as permanent quarters ol legions became, as elsewhere in the
empire, centres round which a Romanised population grew up ⁴. The
same must have been the case with the scaports through which the com·
merce with the continent may have passed, as Portus Lemanis (Lymne) ⁶,
Rutupiae (Richborough), Regulbium (Reculver), Dubris (Dover),
Portus Magnus (Porchester)‚ and perhaps Clausentum (Bittem)⁸.
