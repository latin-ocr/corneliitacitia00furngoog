5. Balbos 1„ Cornelius Balbus, a
native of Gades, had obtained citizenship
through Pompeius tCic. pro Balb. 8, 19),
bnt afterwards attachedhrmself to Caesar:
his consulship in 7ι4, rac. 4⁰ (Dio, 48.
32, a), was the first ever attained by a
foreigner (Plin. N. H, 7. 43, 44, 136).
On his nephew, the farst foreigner who

(ii. 9) Claudius says that the colony of
Vienna (Vienne) had long before that
time seut senators to Rome. Its citizens
whom he there specifies are of his own

Appius Claudius Caecus had admitted
