SPEECH OF CLAUDIUS. 209

tberty to ignore such documenta, or to deal with them as he thought
desirable.

On the whole, the substance of the existing portions may be said to
have been given, and the fact that they are represented by but a few
sentences would go to prove that the whole speech (as indeed the
fragments themselves suggest) was long and discursive, and could only
be brought into a space proportionate to the narrative of the Annals by
much omission and abridgment.

The sentences ‘advenae in nos regnavenrnt,' and ‘Omnia patres con-
scripti, quae nunc vetustissima ereduntur, nova fuere : plebeii magistratus
post patricios’ (5 11), seem intended to answer to nearly the whole of the
first column; the continuation, ‘Latini post plebeios, ceterarum Italiae
gentium post Latinos: appears to render the sense of the opening words
of the second. The sentences answering to the remainder of this column
are ‘num paenitet Balbos ex Hispania¹ nec minus insignes virose Gallia
Narbonensi transivisse? manent posteri eorum nec amore in hanc
patriam nobis concedunt’ (ἕ 4), and ‘ac tamen, si cuncta bella recenseas,
nullum breviore spatio quam adversus Gallos confectum: continua inde
et fida pax' (§ 9).

The fact that the order of these sentences does not in any way
correspond to that of those in the original speech would show that
Tacitus, in that process of adaptation to his narrative which he describes t
by the word ‘ invertere,’² considered himself fully at liberty to re-arrange i
as well as to condense, and to give the arguments in what seems to him Ι
to be their most appropriate form and order.

The style and expression is thus his own, and the tedicus antiquarian
pedantry of Claudius is just sufficiently suggested to make the speech ι
characteristic without being wearisome. i

Our means of judgment are necessarily much limited by our inability
to compare the speeches as a whole; auditis also unfortunate for
Tacitus that the only instance in which we are thus able to bring him to
boolt, is one in which such obligations to fidelity as he may have desired
to recognise must have been sorely tried by the literary and rhetorical

defects of his original.
