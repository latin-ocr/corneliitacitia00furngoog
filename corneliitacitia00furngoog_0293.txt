be treated as his freedwomen' (andsub
jected to the disabilities of such) τ for the
two sauses of ‘haberentur' cp. those of
‘habebat' in a. 44, 3. Gaius (i. 84)
represents this case somewhat differently,
‘poterat ipsa ex pactione libera perma-
nere, sed servum procreare,' and adds
that, according to the ordinsnce of
Hadrian, ifthe mother remained free, the
child was tobcfree.

letter (8. 6), Pliny says that the sight of
the inscription cited above had given him
the curiosity to inspect the decrec,
which he quotes at length witha bitter
running commentary. It appears to have
accumulated compliments upon him, to
have urged that he should be pressed to
wear tha golden ring, to have expressed
thanlrs to Caesar for having mentioned
his name and allowed them to testify
their gratitudo, ‘ut Pallas, cni se omnes
pro virili obligatos fatentur, singularis
dei, singularis industriae fructum meritis·
sime ferat’; adding thatthey could not but
wish to show their feeling by augmenting
his means, and only forbore to press that
portion of the decree (notwithstanding
his reluetsnce) in deferencc to the ex-
pressed wish of Caesar, recording their
