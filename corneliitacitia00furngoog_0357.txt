to it for disregardi a summons to the

from this passage (see also Momms ii.
513l that ahigher limit was fixed for the
curule than for the plebeian aediles. The
form ‘aedilis plebeius' for‘aedilis plebi,'
is noted by Momms. (ii. 471, 3) as found
in Fest. and in inscriptions ς and perhaps
‘plebeii' should be here read, as in 11.

the famous person of the name (ro. 28, 2
and note) is identical with this one, his
puaestorship must have been filled under

laudius rather than Nero: the view that
he is addressed by Thrasea as ‘iuvenis'
in 16. 35, 3, is perhaps mistaken.

the regulation of Augustus here referred
to, but his meaning is not freefrom doubt,
and the administration by aediles, of
which Suet Aug. 36) has no knowledge,
is shown by ommsen (ii. 557, 4) not to
have been really permanent. The ordin-
