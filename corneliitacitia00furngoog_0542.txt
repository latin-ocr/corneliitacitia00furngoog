uses ‘socii' more generally, aa in ‘foederi to various temples built by him (see N.
sociae urbis' (a. 55, 5).. H. 54 8, 19, 84). Pergamum appears to

5. auro: such offerings of gold are
often mentioned in Livy, etc.

· triumphis. . . votis, ‘on occasions
ol triumphs or vows.' The construction
seems analogous to the simple abl. of
time and place: cp. ‘proconsulatu’ (H.
r. 48, 6), and otber expressions quoted by
Nipp. 664. 51, 1.

astate of circumstances, rather than a
frame of mind, as in 1. 40, r (where see
