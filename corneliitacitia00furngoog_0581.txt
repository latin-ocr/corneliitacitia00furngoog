Tan deep interest attaching to the subject of this chapter, and the fact
that no other circumstantial account of the event is preserved to us, have
caused it to receive an attention beyond the deserts of its real historical
value. In this respect it cannot be ranked with the letter of Pliny ¹, in
which a governor of a province is officially reporting to his emperor
contemporary facts brought before him in his judicial capacity, and
which he was under every obligation to ascertain and state correctly²;

with any pains to disguise the writer’s animosity towards a detested and
despised religion ⁶.
