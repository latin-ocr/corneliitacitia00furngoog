NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS. 571

Christian forgery, but on grounds slender in themselves ¹, and involving,
as the objector himself sees, a similar attack on the other passages
in classical authors of this period ². It may be sufficient to point out
that Sulpicius Sevenm, who has transcribed words of Tacitus in an un·
questioned passage (c. 37, 8), bas also transcribed a portion of this (see
on 5 3); also that the style is thorougbly Tacitean throughout, containing
a number of words and expressions elsewhere used hythe author, and
more or less characteristic of bim, yet without any such elaborate over·
imitation as we should expect to detect in even a skilful forgery ⁸.
Nor is the subject-matter less characteristic, if we note the struggle
between the extreme bitterness and animosity of tbe general view, and
the sense of candour and historieal fidelity in dealing with the actual
charge against the sufierers, the grudging and hardly acknowledged
sympathy, the many unexplained difficulties to which his evident un·
willingness to dwell longer on the subject than he can help gives rise.
lt must seem strange that any one who has studied the interpolated
passage in Josephus ⁴, or the correspondence of St. Paul and Senecal,
should suppose that itis only a similar, but somewhat more skilful
performance of tbe same kind that lies bere before us

The genuineness of the passage being assumed, we may add that only
in one or two places does the Medicean text appear to be corrupt ⁶.
lt would seem also that we are bere in possession of all that Tacitus
has thought fit (at least in the Annals) to tell us concerning the
Christiane as sucb; the mode of reference to the subject here being
such as strongly to malie agaimt the supposition that the lost Fifth
