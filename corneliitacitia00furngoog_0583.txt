origin of Christianity or of the life of Christ to supplement the bare
record here vouchsafed¹.

Leaving the various difficulties of detail to be dealt with in the notes
on the passage, it is proposed here to discuss some of the general
grounds on which the credibility of the narrative as given by Tacitus
hasbeen called in question.

The narrative brings in no other originating agency than that of Nero,
who, to divert the imputation from himself, ‘sets up culprits’ to sustain
the charge3 and the great difficulty of explaining how the Christiane
came to be selected for the purpose is either ignored or supposed to lind
its solution in the fact that they were ‘detested for their abominations,¹
and notorious for ‘hatred of the human race‚’ and were therefore presum-
ably persons against whom any charge could be beheved, as well as being
sufficiently numerous to glut the public appetite for vengeance. But
such an explanation seems only to increase the difficulty by its contrast
with the impression suggested from other sources; according to which
the Christian body in Rome at that date has been believed to have been
neither considerable in numbers, nor so well known to the outer world
asto have aroused its hatred, or to have then incurred the imputations
current no doubt in the age of Tacitus, but which he has been here
thought to have antedated. lt suspicion had arisen or was sought to
be propagated, tracing the origin of the lire to an act of religious
fanaticism, its more natural objecta would have been the Jews, who were
then living at Rome in very great numbers, and who as a body had
twice at least before this time drawn down upon themselves the inter·
ference of the govemment², and whose religion is noticed with more
or less asperity by all the chief extant writers of the Neronian period ³,
