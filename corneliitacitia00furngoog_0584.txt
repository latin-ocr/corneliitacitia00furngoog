NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS. 573

while that ο1 the Christians is as universally ignored ¹, and is generally
supposed to have hardly got beyond the stage at which it was reckoned
by Romans merely as a Jewish sect, parted irorn the main body by what
11111111 11 be obscure and even unintelligible differenoes ¹.

The theorice which seek an explanation ol' these difficulties in
some confusion between Jews aud Christiane may be briefly given as
iollows :-

1. It has been conjectured³ that the real victims were zealot Jews,
who had taken a local nanre lrom Judas oi Galilee, and whose existence
had been so iorgotten when Tacitus wrote as to cause them to be
confounded with the Panchaia* proper or Christians, to whom Tacitus
has appropriated ‘the sufferings which he might with lar greater truth
aud justice 'have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost
extinguished! This opinion, in its original lorm, has found lewis any
supporters ⁵3 but has suggested others to which the same objections are
not applicable.

1. It has been thought⁸ that the blow fell ou both bodies, but that the
memory oi the Christian sufferers has been alone preserved; that the
name 11 ‘Christus' as that oi the expected Messiah was uo less upon
the lips 11 Jews than Christiana and that the turbulent followers oi
some false Christ⁷ drew down an attack upon themselves, which extended
itself by their malicious information⁸, or by want oi discrimination in
the judges, to all Christ-worshippers as such,
