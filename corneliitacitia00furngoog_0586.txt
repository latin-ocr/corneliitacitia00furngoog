NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS. 575

Jewish origin, and (as they believed) bound up with Jewish nationality,
was not only distinct from, but fundamentally opposed to Judaism ¹.

It seems also implied, though not so plainly, that Tacitus found the
Christiane described in his authorities as ‘per flagitia invisi'; and
although our only explicit knowledge of such imputations is of con·
siderably later date², there is some independent reason to think that
such were already current⁸ ; and they may well have been raked together
and made the most of by their adversaries on this occasion.

There is reason to suppose that the apparently small number of the
brethren at the date of St. Paul’s arrival at Rome* may have been
materially increased by the effect of his two years of preaching and
instruction⁶; but the description oi the sufferers as ‘a vast multitude’
must be taken as a rhetorical expression which we have no means of
reducing to a numerical estimaret Archaeology has unfortunately been
ableto throw hardly any light on the numbers or importance of the
Christiane in Rome at so early a date ⁷.

Among other classical authors, the only express reference to the
subject⁸ is that of Suetonius, which, as faras it goes, shows evidence
of being drawn from an independent source ⁹, and no less clearly marks
