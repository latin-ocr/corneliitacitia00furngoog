the victims as not Jews but Christians. The earliest express reference
to any Neronian persecution in a Christian writer is that in the fragment
preserved by Eusebius ¹. of the Apology addressed to M. Aurelius by
Melito, Bishop of Sardis, about an. 170, which, without showing any
knowledge of the circumstances as described by Tacitus, sets forth the
two most wicked emperors, Nero and Domitian, as having become, at
the suggestion of evil counsellors‚ the only persecutors of the Christians ².
The same note is dwelt upon at greater length by Tertullian‚ who,
though he refers his adversaries to the statements of their own writers,
and has elsewhere³ distinctly cited Tacitus, shows no knowledge of this
passage of the Annals ⁴. By others, as Lactantius ⁵, Eusebius ⁸, and
Jerome', Nero is spoken ofin general terms as a persecutor, with no
allusion to these many and nameless victims, but as having caused the
martyrdom of St. Peter and St. Paul; and it is in Sulpicius Severus
alone that any unmistakeable following of the narrative of Tacitus is
shown ⁸.

There remain also to be noticed allusions in two Christian books of ·

earlier date than that of Tacitus and Suetonius, which, without containing
the name of Nero, or referring indisputably to this massacre, seem
difficult to be explained or understood without supposing some distinct
reference to it.

The least open to question is that in the first Epistle of St. Clement to
the Corinthians, which is with probability taken to have been written in or
about the last year of Domitian ⁹, and which appears distinctly to allude
