NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS. 579

been as great as Tacitus would lead us to suppose ¹. It is however
to be borne in mind that the interest os posterity gathered chiefly round
eminent individual martyrs3 whence the conception ol Nero as a per·
secutor would naturally be rather associated with the deaths oi the great
Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul than with those ol obscure, though even
numerous victims, who lelt no name and appear in no martyrology².

It will be seen that we do not find evidence in classical or Christian
record lor the supposition that this massacre tel chiefly or even j0intly
on the Jewish body ⁸. Nor has any Jewish tradition to that effect come
down to us; and the complete silence ol Josephus, who could not well
either have been ignorant ol any such terrible sufferings undergone by
his coreligionists‚ or have sailed to record thern il known to him, must
have considerable weight in such a case ⁴.

On the other band, the theory that the Jews may have considered
themselves in danger, and may have been enabled to secule their own
salety, and to shift tlte suspicion to tbe Christians by means ol their
influence at court, though equally unattested, is certainly so lar a ‘vera
causa,’ that we have clear evidence ol Poppaea's leaning toward the
Jews ⁶, and ol her interposition on two occasions on their behall⁰ 3 to

the Christiane, and previous attempts to arraign St. Paul and others
before provincial tribunals. We appear thus to see that they had
opportunity, and that probably they alone had motives, for endeavoun'ng
to fasten upon the Christiana a charge likely in such a state of excite-
ment to win ready belief, and that they must have had power, such as
probably no others would have had, to give such information as to their
