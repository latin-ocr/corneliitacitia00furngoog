surgents under Eleazar and his rival Manahem ¹. After seven days oi
comparative inaction, the contest was soon decided. The castle oi
Antonia was carried aiter two days' assault, and its garrison put to the
sword; the palace ol the Upper City, alter a more vigorous resistauee,
was evacuated under capitulation by the troops of Agrippa, and the
remaining Romans, who had taken refuge in the three towers ol Herod,
were induced to surrender on similar terma, and then slain in defiance ol
the agreement ⁸.

A great massacre os Jews by Greeks, which had taken place at the
same time ³ at Caesarea, and had been followed by similar scenes at many
other places ⁴, made the struggle more internecine; and the victorious
party at Jerusalem, encouraged, as they believed, by the voice of
prophecy ⁵, took the offensive in the surrounding country.

A greater crisis now ensued on the advance of Cestius Gallus, the
legatus oi Syria⁶, with a large force ol legionary and other troops, to
put down the insurrection. Alter meeting with little resistance and in-
ilicting many cruelties elsewhere ⁷, he sustained a severe checlr near
Beth-horon ⁸, but was enabled hythe dissensions oi his adversaries to ad-
vance to the neighbourhood oi Jerusalem, and even into the city 3 whence,
aiter ieeble attempts to assault the Upper City and the Temple, he set
out on a retreat almost degenerating into a rout, in which nearly 6000 oi
his troops were killed ⁹. On this success not only Judaea, but also
Galilee, Samaria, Peraea, and Idumaea, burst out into a blare ol open
rebellion.
