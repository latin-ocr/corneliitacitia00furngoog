May aa, and carried the place by storm 00 the forty·seventh day of the
siege ¹, and had purposed to send Josephus to Rome, but was induced
to retain him in honourable custody². loppa, Tiberias, Taricheae,
Gamala, Gischala, were either surrendered or taken by storm in the
course of this year’s campaign, by the end of which all Galilce and the
North were reduced ³. Meanwhile the population of Jerusalem had been
swelled by various country bande, through whom the fanatical party had
got more and more the upper hand. Disunion was everywhere prevalent3
no single leader obtained general recognition ; and things were rapidly
drifiing into the state 01 anarchy and confusion in which they were
found at the beginning of the actual siege ⁴.

For the rest of this year we have little more than a narrative of Nero's
doings in Greece. The calendar had been altered, so as 10 make all the
great Greek games fall within the same year3 and at all of them he
entered as a competitor in various comesta, even such as had not usually
formed part of the programmel, acted all kinds of parts, however un-
dignified or unmanly, and affected 10 conform 10 all rules of the profession,
and to stand 10 fear of the decision of the judgcs⁸. He attained, as a
matter of course, the honours of a reprodeviepr⁷; the names of the famous
musicians Terpnus, Diodorus, and Pammenes being mentioned among
those defeated by him ⁸3 and he is stated to have given large sums to the
Hellanodicae for their decision, and to the Pythia for afelicitous prophecy,
but to have taken vengeance on the adytum of Apollo for some fancied
insuit ⁹. He entered himself also (employing the consular Cluvius
Rufus as his herald) in the local contests of all Greek cities, except Sparta
and Athens, deterred in the former case (as was supposed) by the as-
sociations of the laws of Lycurgus, 10 1110 latter by the fear of the
Erinnyes ¹⁰.

It is stated that he also pilfaged the cities and temples of their works
of art, carrying off 500 statues from Delphi alone ¹¹ ; also that he put to
