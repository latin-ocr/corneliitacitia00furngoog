slew himself in despair3 and Verginius moumed for him, and retired to
his province ¹, refusing himself to be proclaimed emperor or to allow any
one else ιο become so, except by the nomination of the senate and
people at Rome ¹. These events drove Galba almost to despair, and he
went into retirement at Clunia in his province ¹.

Nero meanwhile was acting with the greatest wealiness and indecision.
He is stated to have at first wholly disregarded the news of the rising of
Vindex, and even to have professed his joy at the opportunity offered for
extortion from the Gauls ⁴. After eight days¹ spent in all his usual amuse-
ments at Naples, he returned to Rome and issued a proclamation ⁸. Then
he was thrown into consternation by the news that Galba had been pro-
claimed emperor, and was receiving general support ¹. Some show was
now made of vigour, and the available troops were collected by recalling
the forces already on their way to the Caucasus ⁸ and to Aethiopia ¹, sum-
moning others froiu illyricum ¹⁰, and forming a new legion of the ‘clas-
siarii’ ¹¹. Nero himself assumed the consulship¹², and appointed as leaders
of his troops Petronius Turpilianus and Rubrius Gallus ¹⁸, and sent ¹ Calvia
Crispinilla to instigate Claudius Macer, the imperial legatus in Africa, to
ensure the fidelity of Rome by threatening it with famine ¹⁴! The news
